I am trying to setup this blog to be bilingual for several days already - i.e. to be able to write in both Bulgarian and English, and be able to switch posts easily. I tried several [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) plug-ins, including [Polyglot](http://www.fredfred.net/skriker/index.php/polyglot) and [Language Switcher](http://poplarware.com/languageplugin.html), but for one reason or another it was not happening. Now I believe I got it, however - I downloaded** [jLanguage](http://jakobj.dk/blog/archives/38)** and it seems to work fine.

Feel free to try it yourself, by clicking on the flags at the bottom of this post ;).
