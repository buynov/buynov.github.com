[bulgarian]Любопитен линк: [Java Was Strongly Influenced by Objective-C](http://www.virtualschool.edu/objectivec/influenceOnJava.html).

Java като език бил силно повлиян от [Objective-C](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C), който тогава е използван от екипа на [NeXTSTEP](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXTSTEP). NeXTSTEP пък е операционната система на [NeXT](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT), фирмата която Стив Джобс създава след като напуска Apple през 1985. Накрая, и до ден днешен Objective-C е основния език за програмиране в Apple, включително и за iPhone.

[english]Interesting link: [Java Was Strongly Influenced by Objective-C](http://www.virtualschool.edu/objectivec/influenceOnJava.html).

Java as a programming language was strongly influenced by [Objective-C](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C), which was then used by the [NeXTSTEP](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXTSTEP) team. NeXTSTEP was the operating system made by [NeXT](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT), the company that Steve Jobs founded after he left Apple in 1985. Finally, as of today Objective-C is the main programming language used by Apple, including for the iPhone.
