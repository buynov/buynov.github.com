In [this presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/fowler-ruby) from [QCon](http://qcon.infoq.com/), [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com) shares the experience of [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/). There is a transcript of the presentation, [here](http://martinfowler.com/articles/rubyAtThoughtWorks.html).

For three years ThoughtWorks worked on 41 projects with Ruby (and [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), primarily). Including one product of their own, [Ðœingle](http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-agile-project-management).

For me personally, the main points are:
	
  * With Ruby and Rails the programmers are more productive and they like working with it.
  * From the performance perspective, Ruby and Rails are slow, compared to other similar frameworks. Just [look at the hardware requirements](http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-agile-project-management/2.3/help/system_requirements.html) for Mingle for 40-50 users!
  * Ruby is not a mature technology. It lack developer instruments, for example. And I wouldn't believe they are not needed.
