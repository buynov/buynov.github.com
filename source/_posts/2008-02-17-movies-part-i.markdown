There are a few movies, which are not very popular, but I like a lot. I hope you will enjoy them, too.

	
[![Rozencrantz and Guildenstern](/images/2008/02/rozencrantz_and_guildenstern.jpg)](http://imdb.com/title/tt0100519/)

[**Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead**](http://imdb.com/title/tt0100519/)

Knowing the story of "Hamlet" is not required, but it helps to some extend. The movie tells the story of the two friends of Hamlet - Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who are slightly mentioned in the original story. Young  [Tim Roth](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000619/) and [Gary Oldman](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000198/) show an excellent performance, but one of the greater presences in the movie belongs to [Richard Dreyfuss](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000377/), in my opinion.
Although silly and funny at first sight, the characters make you ponder long after the movie's over. This I like the most in such stories.
	
[![Big Kahuna](/images/2008/02/big_kahuna.jpg)](http://imdb.com/title/tt0189584/)

[**The Big Kahuna**](http://imdb.com/title/tt0189584/)

[Danny DeVito](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000362/) and [Kevin Spacey](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000228/) are playing merchandisers from an American motor oil company in show like a Television theater. The best line belongs to Danny DeVito in this case:


> _... you've already done a plenty of things to regret, you just don't know what they are._


	
[![Glengarry Glen Ross](/images/2008/02/glengarry_glen_ross.jpg)](http://imdb.com/title/tt0104348/)

[**Glengarry Glen Ross**](http://imdb.com/title/tt0104348/)

A constellation of great actors - [Al Pacino](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000199/), [Alec Baldwin](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000285/), [Jack Lemmon](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000493/), [Kevin Spacey](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000228/), [Ed Harris](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000438/), in another Television theater worth remembering. The story takes place in the office of a real-estate company most of the time, where brokers try to make their living.

To me, this movie is very indicative for the way of life in the States, where (not having a direct connection with this particular script) if you kill a man, you might get away with it, but if you hide your taxes, you are not likely to.
	
[![Big Trouble](/images/2008/02/big_trouble.jpg)](http://imdb.com/title/tt0246464/)

[**Big Trouble**](http://imdb.com/title/tt0246464/)

I came across this film accidentally and I liked it a lot. If you want to see a relaxing and very funny movie, I warmly recommend "Big Trouble".

Not very impressing, but successful cast - [Tim Allen](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000741/) and [Rene Russo](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000623/) are leading the show, [Dennis Farina](http://imdb.com/name/nm0001199/) and [Tom Sizemore](http://imdb.com/name/nm0001744/) shine in their supporting roles.
