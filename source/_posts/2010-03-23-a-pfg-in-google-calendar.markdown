Did you know, that you can subscribes to the games of your favorite team in ["A" PFG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_A_Professional_Football_Group) (yes, the Bulgarian A Professional Football Group) in [Google Calendar](http://google.com/reader)?
	
  1. If you have a [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com) account, login (_if you don't, what are you waiting for!? it's free_) and choose **Calendar** from the upper left navigation
  2. Choose **Settings** from upper right corner
  3. Choose the **Calendars** tab
  4. Press the **Browse Interesting Calendars** link
  5. Choose the **Sports** tab
  6. Then **Soccer**
  7. Now click on "**Bulgarian A Professional Football Group - BULG**" and press **Subscribe** next to teams you want to follow

And that's it. Note that the visiting team's name comes first (in contrast to what we are used to in Bulgaria). The coolest thing is, that you can see the results for the games, that have passed - and you thought nobody cares about the Bulgarian football...
You can also add the games of other teams, you feel passionate about, from other championships.

On the fifth step if you choose **Holidays**, you can add the official holidays for different countries in the world (alas, Bulgaria is missing). This way if you are working with Americans, for example, you can impress them by congratulating them in time.
If you choose **More**, there are other interesting calendars you can use - e.g. moon phases, consecutive day of the year, consecutive week of the year, sunrise and sunset times for your city, etc.
