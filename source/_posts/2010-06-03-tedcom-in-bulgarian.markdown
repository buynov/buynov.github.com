It might not be news, but just today I realized, that some of the TED presentations have subtitles. Including my mother tongue, Bulgarian!


Here are a few of my favorite videos, translated in Bulgarian (watch them, you won't regret it):
	
  * [Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/lang/bul/david_pogue_says_simplicity_sells.html)
  * [David Pogue says "Simplicity sells"](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/lang/bul/david_pogue_says_simplicity_sells.html)
  * [Al Gore on averting climate crisis](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/lang/bul/al_gore_on_averting_climate_crisis.html?ga_source=embed)
  * [Dan Gilbert asks, Why are we happy?](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/bul/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html)


Here you can search TED videos by the subtitle languages, available for them:
