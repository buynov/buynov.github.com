It is not common for Bulgaria to make it into the world Hi-Tech news - especially for being the first place in Europe where new mobile phone will be offered (actually the news is not the device itself, but the fact that it comes with Android 2.1).

[Motorola  Milestone with Android 2.1 hitting Bulgaria by March 20th, rest of  Europe to follow?](http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/12/motorola-milestone-with-android-2-1-hitting-bulgaria-by-march-20/)

Here is the source from Bulgaria, Mobile Bulgaria:

[VIVACOM offers Motorola MILESTONE exclusively, comes with Android 2.1](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=1&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobilebulgaria.com%2Fnews%2Fview.php%3Fid%3D15362&sl=bg&tl=en)

Taking aside the fact, that the reason for the news is the shameful offering from Vivacom (_330 EURO initially and 35 EURO each month after that?! For 2 whole YEARS?! And this is for only 100 MB of data traffic per month!?!? Viva who???_), it is a remarkable occasion. Especially since the author of the news is not the Bulgarian in Engadget, [Vladislav Savov](http://www.engadget.com/editor/vladislav-savov). Apparently, we have a place on the technological map of the world, too.

[Not a word](http://vivacom.bg/en/residential/devices/section/mobile_phones/list/?sc[0]=15&option=1) about the offering on the official Vivacom website. Typical.
