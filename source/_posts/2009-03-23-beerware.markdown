[![beerware](/images/2009/03/beerware-300x154.jpg)](/images/2009/03/beerware.jpg)

I read about a really interesting idea.
The fact is, people don't like to pay for something, that they get for free. Keeping that in mind, what can you do if you offer something free of charge, and would like, nevertheless, to get some support for your efforts? Here are some arguments:
	
  * If you put aÂ  **Donate** button on your site, there will hardly be many users, willing to give you money just because the button is there (although you did something useful, which they download).
  * If you put **Google Ads** on your site, the users would hardly click on the links there, as they just get used to ignoring them (you did too, right?).

Therefore, [why don't they buy you a beer ;)](http://www.flattermann.net/2009/02/flattermannnet-becomes-beer-ware/).
