Better later, than never ...
After a delay of about two months, I decided finally to write and publish this post. I find it appropriate to conclude the topic, since I started it ([1](/blog/2009/05/11/oracle-to-buy-sun/),  [2](/blog/2009/07/19/oracle-to-buy-sun-part-two/),  [3](/blog/2010/01/22/oracle-to-buy-sun-part-three/)).

Oracle finalized the acquisition of SUN on **January 27**, 2010. Here's the official press release:

[Oracle Completes Acquisition of Sun](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/044428)

You can find more information about the deal on [this site](http://www.oracle.com/sun/). It is worth noting, that Oracle organized a dedicated all-day event, to present their ideas and strategies for the products, they acquired from SUN. There is a webcast from all the presentations from the event here:

[Oracle + Sun: Transforming the IT Industry](http://www.oracle.com/us/sun/044498)

If you don't feel like watching 5 hours of webcasts, here are two links to help you catch up without having to spend too much time:
