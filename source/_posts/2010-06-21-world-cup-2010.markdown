It is different, in a way (a positive way) when there is a FIFA World Cup going on. It is good to know that there are three games each day, each of them having the potential to become [one](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249722/match=300061464/index.html) or [another](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249722/match=300061482/index.html) sensation. In regard to the World Cup is one of the best [tweets](http://twitter.com/) I came across lately:
