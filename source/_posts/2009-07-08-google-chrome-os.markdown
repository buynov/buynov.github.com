Google [announced today](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html), that they intend to release their own operating system, called **Google Chrome OS**. The announcement is commented everywhere on the web:
	
  * [The official Google blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html)
  * [BBC: Google to launch operating system](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8139711.stm)
  * [InfoQ: Google Takes Aim at Microsoft with a New Operating System, Google Chrome OS](http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/07/Google-Chrome-OS)
  * [Slashdot: Google Announces Chrome OS, For Release Mid-2010](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/07/08/0953238/Google-Announces-Chrome-OS-For-Release-Mid-2010?from=rss)

The new OS will be (of course) open sourced, will have enhanced security model and will emphasise on simplicity and speed. The first computers running it will be available in the second quarter of 2010 and will be netbooks.

On one hand, it is normal for Google to take advantage of the speed they gathered and grab a bite of Microsoft's main course â€“ the OS market. Especially since Microsoft are investing heavily in their new search engine, [Bing](http://www.bing.com/), and are trying to attract Google users.

But on the other hand, the announcement is, least to say, surprising. Google already have their own operating system, [**Android**](http://www.android.com/), which picks up speed pretty fast and although designed for mobile devices, different people and companies are trying to adapt it to other devices for some time now, and netbooks in particular. Here are just a few examples:

  * [CNET: HP considers Google Android for Netbooks](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10208594-94.html?tag=mncol;txt)
  * [Engadget: First Acer Android netbook will dual-boot Windows](http://www.engadget.com/2009/06/05/first-acer-android-netbook-will-dual-boot-windows/)
  * [Android netbooks on their way, likely by 2010](http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/01/01/android-netbooks-on-their-way-likely-by-2010/)
  * [First Google Android Netbooks spotted](http://blogs.computerworld.com/first_google_android_netbooks_spotted)
  * [Reuters: Acer to sell Android netbook PCs in Q3](http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSTP18980620090602)

So, why would Google want another operating system, if they already have one, which is becoming more and more popular and is attracting attention from the community? Is this about a new operating system or about different versions  (Android and Chrome OS) of the same platform? We will have to wait until 2010 and see.
