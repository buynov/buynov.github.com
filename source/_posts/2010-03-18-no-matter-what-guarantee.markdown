Now, [THIS](https://www.nomatterwhatguarantee.com/main_structure.php?page=home) is what I call a WARRANTY:


> **Satisfaction guarantee**
You can return your laptop within 14 calendar days after the date of purchase. The laptop must be undamaged and cannot have any missing items. Toshiba will replace your laptop or give you your money back.
_(fantastic, whooho, fantastic, fantastic)_

> **Accidental damage coverage**
The guarantee covers any type of damage or accidental destruction of your laptop that impacts its functionality. Toshiba will replace or repair your laptop.
_(great, great,  yupee)_

> **Theft coverage**
The guarantee covers theft of the laptop that has been reported to the police. Toshiba will replace your laptop.
_(wonderful, yahoo, wonderful,  wonderful)_

> **Unemployment coverage** (_!!!- my personal favorite_)
From May 1st 2009 Toshiba additionally covers you in case you get unemployed. **Toshiba will give you your money back and you can keep the laptop** if your contract gets terminated for longer than 3 months.


The promotional guarantee is valid up until March 31st and seems to only be applicable for the [countries listed here](http://www.nomatterwhatguarantee.com). In order to take advantage of the offer you must register your newly bought Toshiba laptop, within 7 days after the purchase, on two web sites:Â  [the standard warranty registration portal](http://www.toshiba-europe.com/registration) and [the promotional site](http://www.nomatterwhatguarantee.com).  The promotional warranty is valid only for the country you registered with, and only for adult citizens of that country. You cannot register a laptop you bought on credit.

Where's the "catch"? You are only allowed one complaint within a year.
If you decide to benefit from this offering, it is really useful to take a look at the** 5. Exclusions** section from the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.nomatterwhatguarantee.com/download/TC_Trust_Toshiba_MA.pdf) of the promotion. The warranty is not valid, for example, if you are a victim of a robbery without violence or burglary - it does sound cynical, but they want a document from the police or from a doctor.

Taking the above into consideration, the offer seems to be worth a try. And judging by the [webpage with the Terms and Conditions](https://www.nomatterwhatguarantee.com/content/tc_show_M.php?reg=0), it seems to be regular.
