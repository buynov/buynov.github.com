I don't know if you knew it, but my home [town of Pernik](http://pernik.info/) is a member of the [European Federation of Carnival Cities](http://www.carnivalcities.com/). The Festival of Masquerade Games in Pernik even has an [official site](http://www.surva.org/). The festival is being held each year, but it has international presence only on even years - on odd years only local ensembles participate. Here are a few pictures from the festival this year, which was held on January 26 and 27:<!-- more -->

[![Picture 1](/images/2008/01/dsc00826_small.jpg)](/images/2008/01/dsc00826_small.jpg)The sign on the top of the building in the background says "Glory to the Miner's Labour" ;).

[![Снимка 2](/images/2008/01/dsc00827_small.jpg)](/images/2008/01/dsc00827_small.jpg)The group from the village of Divotino has one of the most significant presences each year.

[![Снимка 4](/images/2008/01/dsc00831_small.jpg)](/images/2008/01/dsc00831_small.jpg) I told you that the group from Divotino has one of the most significant presenes - the letters on top of the people say DIVOTINO in cyrillic.

[![Снимка 5](/images/2008/01/dsc00836_small.jpg)](/images/2008/01/dsc00836_small.jpg) There is no age limit to the participants.

[![Снимка 6](/images/2008/01/dsc00843_small.jpg)](/images/2008/01/dsc00843_small.jpg) There was a video wall and an official stage.
