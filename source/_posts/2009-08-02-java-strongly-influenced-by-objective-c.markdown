Interesting link: [Java Was Strongly Influenced by Objective-C](http://www.virtualschool.edu/objectivec/influenceOnJava.html).

Java as a programming language was strongly influenced by [Objective-C](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C), which was then used by the [NeXTSTEP](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXTSTEP) team. NeXTSTEP was the operating system made by [NeXT](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT), the company that Steve Jobs founded after he left Apple in 1985. Finally, as of today Objective-C is the main programming language used by Apple, including for the iPhone.
