Sometime ago, I read a quotation somewhere, which belongs to [Savielly Tartakower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ksawery_Tartakower), if I am not mistaken. The one I read mentions chess players, but it refers to people in general, I think:

> There are chess players, who play poorly, but who know they play poorly. They are **reasonable** - help them.

> There are chess players, who play poorly, but who don't know they play poorly. They are **ignorant** - avoid them.

> There are chess players, who play good and who don't know they play good. They are **modest** - respect them.

> There are chess players, who play good and who know they play good. They are **the chess gurus** - follow them.

In this case it is not important to label people and to classify them, in my opinion. Much more important it is to take a moment and answer a very simple question - **which are you from?**[/english]
