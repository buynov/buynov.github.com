Every IT professional must take his place in the internet. A matter of prestige.

Register your domain name, buy a hosting service and then - whatever you feel comfortable with. If you want my advice, look for a hosting with CPanel - very good tool. Not to mention that it contains everything you would need, including CMS, Blog, Image Gallery, etc.

There is no need to hesitate - are you an IT professional, or not?
