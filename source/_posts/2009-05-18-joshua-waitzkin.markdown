[Joshua Waitzkin](http://www.joshwaitzkin.com/) is the prototype for the lead character in the movie "[Searching for Bobby Fischer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108065/)". He is also the author of the tutorials for [some versions of Chessmaster](http://www.ubi.com/US/Games/Info.aspx?pId=5893).

I haven't heard about him for a long time - he used to be a very promising American chess player and somehow disappeared (from my sight at least). And recently I came across [an interesting interview of his in Google](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTZS3SqpT-o). He talks about how he started playing chess, how he decided to give up chess (because he did not feel like becoming the best player) and how he not only started training martial arts, but became a Tai Chi world champion (if I understood correctly). A really interesting transformation - this explains to some extend the popularity ofÂ  [chess-boxing](http://wcbo.org) ;)

I personally liked the interview - I hope you will enjoy it too.
