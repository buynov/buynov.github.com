I never thought about this, but there is a very simple symptom to make you realize that the economy is in crisis. You can be certain that it is a fact, when the banks begin to advertise mainly **deposits**.

Accordingly, if the banks are advertising **credits**, this means that the economy is progressing. Plain and simple :).
