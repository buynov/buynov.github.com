I recalled "[Geri's Game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IYRC7g2ICg)" today, the 5-minute Pixar movie, which won [an Oscar for Best Short Animated Film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geri%27s_Game) in 1998. If you missed to watch it, take this chance to do it ;).

When I watched it i recalled something else. Notice how at the end of the game, Geri knocks down his King, which comes to tell, that he resigns. The same action can be observed in the following two scenes from "[Searching for Bobby Fischer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108065/)" (as well as in a bunch of other Holywood movies):
	
  * [Young Joshua plays chess with young Monk ;)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDZSqnzXQJc)
  * [The ending scene of the movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujQdE_2tBqk)

Remember this from me - chess is a game for gentlemen. If you ever play chess with somebody else (not like Geri, with himself ;)) and you happen to loose, be the first to shake your opponent's hand and congratulate him with his victory. Because in order to learn how to win, you first have to learn how to loose with dignity. The handshake before and after the game is so important, that it is grounded in the rules of  [FIDE](http://www.fide.com/) - remember [the scandal with Ivan Cheparinov](http://www.dnevnik.bg/sport/2008/01/20/449938_slujebna_zaguba_na_ivan_cheparinov_na_shah_turnira_v/) last year:

> Any player who does not shake hands with the opponent (or greets the opponent in a normal social manner in accordance with the conventional            rules of their society) before the game starts in a FIDE tournament or during a FIDE match (and does not do it after being asked to do so by the arbiter) or deliberately insults his/her opponent or the officials of the event, will immediately and finally lose the relevant game.

In fact, the game was replayed, but this is not important for what I am trying to say.

As with knocking your king down, forget it - it's a Holywood bullsh*t.
