After the American regulatory institutions approved the [deal for Oracle to aquire SUN](/blog/2009/05/11/oracle-to-buy-sun/) last summer, the European commission did the same, about 9 months after the deal was announced:

	
  * [European Commission Unconditionally Approves Oracleâ€™s Acquisition of Sun](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/043873)
	
  * [EU backs Oracle's takeover of Sun](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8473136.stm)


However, the saga does not seem to end - now it appears that the deal should be approved by the competition authorities in Russia and China.
