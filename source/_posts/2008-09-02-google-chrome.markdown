It was an interesting day today. First I learned, that [Dimitar Berbatov finally signed with Manchester United](http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12193_4084908,00.html), then I read that [Google are releasing their own browser](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/), which is big news. The rumors that Google are developing a web browser from 2-3 years ago, because they bought the _gbrowser.com_ domain turned out to be true. Although there is nothing on [http://www.gbrowser.com](http://www.gbrowser.com) as of today, a browser is already available, just a few hours after I heard about it: [http://www.google.com/chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).

Overall the browser seems to be fast and the interface is quite clean (note that the page tabs are located in the title bar, probably to save some space). There is a Bulgarian localization of the user interface and the Firefox shortcuts are working, for example **Ctrl-T** to open a new tab, **Ctrl-"+"** / **Ctrl-"-"** / **Ctrl-0** for zooming, **Alt-Home** to navigate to the home page.

There seems to be a problem with Flash, however - if you go to the [Buynomobile page](/buynomobile/) you can see the Chrome freezing, especially if you try to switch between the different pictures in the gallery. Additionally, the zoom is far from perfect - it looks similar to the one in Firefox 2, and the zoom in Firefox 3 is much better. But this is still a preview release and I am sure that there will be improvements soon.

Anyway, competition is a good thing, it is good to have different options to choose from :).
