I received the newsletter from [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/) today and found several interesting things there. First, I found out that [2007 Community Choice Awards](http://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/) are over - you can see the winners and the nominees [here](http://sourceforge.net/community/index.php/landing-pages/cca07/). I took a look, as well as in [Top 25 Projects](http://sourceforge.net/top/mostactive.php?type=week) and found interesting stuff - some of it I will mention below:
	
  * [Launchy ](http://www.launchy.net/)- indisputable hit for me. A tool that allows you to start applications without searching through the Start menu of Windows and shortcuts on your desktop. Install the application, launch it and click `Alt+Space`. Then write a few letters from the name of the application you want to start, and [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/) will let you choose it from a list without having to search for it. And this is not all - you can open a path in Explorer or even write a mathematical expression, [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/) will calculate it for you! Simple but genious :).
	
  * [Stylebase](http://stylebase.sourceforge.net/) for [Eclipse ](http://www.eclipse.org/)- I did not have time to try it, but it looks promising. As it is said on the site:

> Stylebase is a reuse repository for architectural models and design patterns and it assists in applying [quality-driven architecture design](http://virtual.vtt.fi/qada/) into software engineering.

<!-- More -->
	
  * Several applications for administration and monitoring of networks:
	
    * [Zenoss Core](http://www.zenoss.com/product/core) - application, which uses [Python ](http://www.python.org/)and [Zope](http://www.zope.org/). I know a few people, that won't need anything else ;). For the others, here's a brief information from the official site:

> Zenoss Core is an open source IT monitoring product that delivers the functionality to effectively manage the configuration, health, performance of networks, servers and applications through a single, integrated software package.
	
   * [Hobbit Monitor](http://hobbitmon.sourceforge.net/) -  software for monitoring of servers and networks. More information is available on the official site.
	
   * [Webmin](http://www.webmin.com/index.html) - web based interface for remote administration of Unix systems. For me, it sounds quite promising. A demo is supposed to be available [here](https://demo.virtualmin.com:10000/), but it was not working when I tried it.

If you did not look through the other projects on [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/) yet, I advise you to do it - there are quite good ones there. Some people have too much spare time ;). I can dedicate a separate post to the things I use from [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/).
