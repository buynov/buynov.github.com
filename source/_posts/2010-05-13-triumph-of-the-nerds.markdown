"[Triumph of the Nerds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115398/)"  is a fascinating documentary about the dawn of personal computers and the people, who drove (and took advantage) of the process. Including Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Paul Allen, Larry Ellison, etc. Even [Douglas Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams) makes an appearance.

You can watch the movie on YouTube, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jV3JdtaOGc&feature=PlayList&p=4D5CD637F73C24C7&playnext_from=PL&index=0&playnext=1), or to download it [from here](http://www.tinyurl.com/5t5ruq) (take a look at the comment's section below the movie in YouTube).

Scenes from this movie are among the most popular YouTube videos involving Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and are also used in movies like this 10 minute Steve Jobs documentary (keep in mind that the video is old, and the story does not include the release of the iPhone).
