If you missed to follow the news, here's how I saw the events, chronologically:
	
  * **18 March 2009** - Rumor says, that [IBM 	is looking to buy SUN](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/technology/companies/19sun.html). Both companies refused to comment the rumor.
  * **25 March 2009** - [Paul 	Otellini, Intel's CEO commented](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/03/25/intel-ceo-weighs-in-on-ibm-sun-talks/), that "_Sun 	was shopped around the Valley and around the world in the last few months_" and "_A lot of companies got calls or visits on buying some or all the assets of the company _", due to unfavorable financial prospects.
  * **02 April 2009** - Rumor says [the price of the deal was set to around $7 billion](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/technology/business-computing/03blue.html?_r=1&scp=7&sq=ibm%20sun&st=Search), ($9.50 per share). For comparison, SUN was worthed $200 	billion in 2001.
  * **05 April 2009** - [The deal is off](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/technology/business-computing/06blue.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss), after IBM tried to reduce the price to $9.40 per share, according to the rumors.
  * **09 April 2009** - Niel McAllister [perspicaciously presumes](http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/what-if-oracle-bought-sun-microsystems-859) what is about to happen.
  * **20 April 2009** - Without much noise and rumors both companies (Oracle and SUN) together issued press releases on their web sites: [Oracle 	Buys Sun](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/018363) and [Oracle to Buy Sun](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2009-04/sunflash.20090420.1.xml). They've reached a definitive agreement under which Oracle will acquire SUN. The deal is valued at 	approximately $7.4 billion (or $9.50 per share), which corresponds to IBM's initial offer (see above). The contract is subject to _Sun stockholder approval, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions_.
  * **21 April 2009** - [Steve Ballmer and (supposedly) IBM are very surprised by the deal](http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/business/0,39044229,62053383,00.htm). Rumor says, IBM wanted to reduce the price after the initial negotiations were closed.

In most comments over the acquisition SUN is categorized as a hardware (server) manufacturer, but in fact it is much more than that. This is the company that created [the most popular programming language](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html), [Java Community Process](http://jcp.org/), [Open Office](http://www.openoffice.org/), [Open Solaris](http://opensolaris.org/), [ZFS](http://opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/whatis/). The only thing that Oracle are famous about is their truly extraordinary database, but that is it. Well, also with their remarkable inability to provide good Java-based platform for software development. That is why I fully agree with Paul Otellini (see the link above):

> _I'd rather have Sun be independent I guess._
