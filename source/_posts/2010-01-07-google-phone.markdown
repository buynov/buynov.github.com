[![NexusOne](/images/2010/01/NexusOne-156x300.jpg)](/images/2010/01/NexusOne.jpg)

The rumors about the Google phone turned out to be true. Google released [official announcement](http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/01/introducing-nexus-one.html) and a dedicated site, [http://www.google.com/phone](http://www.google.com/phone).

Actually the device is not manufactured by Google, but by HTC (just like the first Android phone, the [G1](http://www.t-mobileg1.com/)), comes with the full set of Google applications (just like the first Android phone, the [G1](http://www.t-mobileg1.com/)) and initially will be offered with a T-Mobile contract (just like the first Android phone, the [G1](http://www.t-mobileg1.com/)). The question is obvious - what the heck is different about the Nexus One ?!

It is very likely that the answer resides in [this announcement](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/our-new-approach-to-buying-mobile-phone.html), from the official Google blog. Google are actually trying to create a distribution channel for Google-branded phones over the internet - with or without contract. And it sounds reasonable - several companies (including Vodafone) that announced to produce/distribute Android cell-phones shared concerns about the strong presence of Google applications in Android, and some even created their own interface (like the HTC's Sense UI).

Through this channel Google actually protect the Android as a platform to access their services from mobile devices. Besides, the [App Store](http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3gs/app-store.html)'s success proved, that such a marketing channel can generate solid revenue - if they attract user's attention, of course.

The interesting thing in this case is, how along the "Google phone" buzz, Google managed to attract a lot of attention for the premier of something quite different than a new type of mobile phone. Almost like Apple are doing it.
