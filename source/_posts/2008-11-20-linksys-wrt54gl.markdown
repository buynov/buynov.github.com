I bought a wireless router, [Linksys WRT54GL](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1133202177241&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper). I looked around, asked several salesmen and they all recommended this particular one. Once I saw a section called "Open Source" on the box, I was hooked :). It's more expensive than other routers in the same category, but since people are recommending it ...

There is a CD with a setup wizard in the box, and it looks very easy - connect the router to the network card of the computer, run the CD on the computer, follow the steps, provide the necessary information and there you are! I had a problem, however. After I inputted all fields and being at one of the last steps of the wizard, where the settings were to be saved on the device, an error occurred. Four-five times in a row. It was not possible to save the settings on the router! I guess the problem was with the firmware of my new gadget, because after I downloaded the latest version [from here](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_CASupport_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1166859841350&packedargs=sku%3D1133202177241&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=4135046472B03&displaypage=download) and upgraded the device (it is very easy, when you login through the web interface on 192.168.1.1, with no username and password "admin"), everything went Ok.

At this stage, a second problem occurred. I called my ISP to change the [MAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) address for my connection. They told me, that the [MAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) address of the router should be written on a sticker on the bottom of the device. Yes, it was there, but as they suggested, it was wrong :). You should know, that in some cases the [MAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) address on the sticker on the bottom of the router is for the local network, not for the internet connection. When I got the device to work it turned out to be different and the ISP support had to change it.

Overall I am happy with the router, because after I got it to work I had no other problems. And I don't have to switch on my home computer to be able to connect to the internet on my laptop and on my smartphone anymore :).

Finally, if you happen to buy such router and you have problems with its setup, download and install the latest firmware, and keep in mind you might have to double check the [MAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) address :).
