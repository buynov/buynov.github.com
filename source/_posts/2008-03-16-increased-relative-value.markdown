Let's say you gave a close friend of yours a treat, and it cost you 10 $. Now let's assume that you earn 1000 $ a month, and your friend 500 $. Here is how I interpret it - you spent 1 % of your monthly income, and your friend received a value of 2 % of his/her monthly income. I call this the **Law of Increased Relative Value** - you automatically get increase (two times in this particular case) of the value of the money you spent. And you don't have to put too much effort into it.
