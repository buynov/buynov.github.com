    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2014/vilamendhoo_spa.jpg" class="fancybox" title="Vilamendhoo, Maldives "><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2014/vilamendhoo_spa.jpg" alt="Vilamendhoo, Maldives " /></a></p>

<p>If you want to get a nice, exotic holiday, at a good price, it might help to try to organize it yourself. There are offers on the internet, which are significantly better than what your local travel agent could offer, and if you invest a little bit of time, you can easily save several hundred bucks. There are a number of sites to find cheap offers for almost anything &ndash; from airline tickets, to hotels, to all-in-one packages.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.holidaypirates.com/flights/cheap-open-jaw-flights-to-maldives-for-only-euro316-up"><img class="right" src="http://buynov.com/images/2014/holiday_pirates_srilankan.png"></a>As an example of how good internet offers can be, I found an airline ticket from Rome (Italy) to Maldives and then back to Frankfurt (Germany) for 316 euro (including taxes, see the screenshot). Truth be told, there are specific dates for this offer and there is a significant layover (8-9 hours) in Colombo (Sri Lanka), but this is still a very good price, nevertheless. I was actually able to find a trip with shorter layover (around 2 hours both ways) for just 350 euro.</p>

<p>I also found an online offer for a beach villa in a resort on Maldives, where you get an all-inclusive package for the price of full board &ndash; a really good deal, having in mind that the difference is around $100 per day if you compare the regular prices.</p>

<h2>Where to look for offers</h2>

<p>I look for travel deals mainly in two &ldquo;families&rdquo; of sites:</p>

<!-- More -->


<p><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2014/holiday_pirates.png" alt="Holiday Pirates" /></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.holidaypirates.com/">Holiday Pirates</a> &ndash; travel deals with departures mainly from UK</li>
<li><a href="http://www.urlaubspiraten.de/">Urlaubs Piraten</a> &ndash; travel deals with departures mainly from Germany</li>
<li><a href="http://www.piratinviaggio.it/">Piratin Viaggio</a> &ndash; travel deals with departures mainly from Italy</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vakantiepiraten.nl/">Vakantie Piraten</a> &ndash; travel deals with departures mainly from Benelux</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2014/travelzoo.png" alt="TravelZoo" /></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.travelzoo.com/uk/top20/">Travel Zoo Top 20 UK</a> &ndash; Top 20 travel deals of the week with departures mainly from UK (updated every Wednesday)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.travelzoo.com/de/top20/">Travel Zoo Top 20 Germany</a> &ndash; Top 20 travel deals of the week with departures mainly from Germany (updated every Wednesday)</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>For websites with unfamiliar languages you can use plugins for automatic translation, like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/s3google-translator/">S3.Google Translator</a> for Firefox, for example. If you like an offer, you could probably work things out with the travel agent in English.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are websites. which publish offers from different sources (agencies, other websites, travel agents) and in most cases the prices are really good. Still, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to check exactly how good a particular offer actually is (see below). There are sections with package deals (including flight and accomodation), plane tickets only and accomodation only. In most cases the offers are valid for very specific dates, so read carefully. It also helps if you can react quickly &ndash; in some cases the offer expires within a day or two (literally).</p>

<p>There are additional websites you can pay a visit to:</p>

<h3>Big travel agents</h3>

<p>The big agencies offer mainly package holidays (the price it best when you get a package), but you can also look for hotels or flight tickets only. They also have a last minute section on their websites (for departures within the next 2-4 weeks) &ndash; it might help to check those out, as well.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>TUI</em>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.tui.com/">TUI Germany</a> &ndash; TUI&rsquo;s main site, with offers for departures from Germany</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thomson.co.uk/">Thomson</a> &ndash; TUI&rsquo;s subsidiary, with offers for departures from UK</li>
<li><a href="http://www.arke.nl">Arke</a> &ndash; TUI&rsquo;s subsidiary, with offers for departures from Netherlands</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thomascook.com/">Thomas Cook</a> &ndash; British travel agent</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kuoni.co.uk/">Kuoni</a> &ndash; British travel agent</li>
</ul>


<h3>Other websites</h3>

<p>Two more sites I&rsquo;ve been checking every once in awhile, which I decided to include.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://holidayplace.co.uk/">The Holiday Place</a> &ndash; well designed and organized site for package deals</li>
<li><a href="http://www.secretescapes.com">Secret Escapes</a> &ndash; website with interesting, a little more luxurious (expensive) offers</li>
</ul>


<h2>Where to check the offer you selected</h2>

<p>Obviously, after you choose a specific offer you need to make sure there are suitable connecting flights from where you live. Be it a low-cost airline (like WizzAir, RyanAir, etc.) or a standard airline, different options are usually available, but it also depends on the specific dates you are looking for. If you need to book an overnight stay because there are no suitable flights for the same day, this may increase the price of the &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; holiday significantly.</p>

<p>Next, check the prices of the offer itself. You can check airline tickets here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.skyscanner.net/">SkyScanner</a> &ndash; website to help you find the cheapest flight tickets (includes low-cost airlines like WizzAir, EasyJet, RyanAir and similar)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.momondo.com/">Momondo</a> &ndash; website to help you find the cheapest flight tickets (includes low-cost airlines like WizzAir, EasyJet, RyanAir and similar)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hipmunk.com/">Hipmunk</a> &ndash; prices on Hipmunk are not always the best (compared to the results from the sites above), but I really like the UI (UX) and the site is very well organized overall</li>
</ul>


<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised if you find a better price. Keep in mind, though, that if you&rsquo;ve selected a package holiday, you might not be able to find the flight here, as it might be a charter or a travel agent flight (which are not listed on these sites).</p>

<p>In addition to the flight itself, make sure you check how much the transfer from the airport costs. In Maldives, for example, the transfer between the capital Male and the resort (usually with a seaplane) can cost you as much as $500 per person (roundtrip), and the price depends on the distance between the airport and the resort. In a lot of cases this transfer is also mandatory &ndash; there are no other means to get there.</p>

<p>For the hotel / accomodation, check the rating and the price here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a> &ndash; along with probably the lowest prices, Booking.com also provides very useful rating system. As a rule of thumb, avoid places with rating below 7 &ndash; rating above 8 is recommended. You might also read a few comments &ndash; they give a pretty good idea of what to expect from the place you are looking at.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/">Trip Advisor</a> &ndash; here you can compare prices for the same place (hotel / resort) from several sources, including <a href="http://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a>, <a href="http://www.hotels.com/">Hotels.com</a>, <a href="http://www.agoda.com/">Agoda</a>, <a href="http://www.expedia.com/">Expedia</a>. They also provide a rating system, which seems adequate. I would much rather check the rating on Booking.com, but some places are just not listed there (not many, but there are a few).</li>
</ul>


<p>You should also keep in mind that in some occassions there are additional taxes and commissions, which are not included in the listed price. For Maldives, for example, you have to pay 8% tax on top of the resort price, and additionally $8 per person per night. This amount is not included in the price listed on <a href="http://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a> and <a href="http://www.expedia.com/">Expedia</a>, and you see it only at the checkout, when you are about to pay. On <a href="http://www.hotels.com/">Hotels.com</a> these are included from the very beginning and you see the actual final price, which seems much fairer to me.</p>

<h2>Booking and payment</h2>

<p>Credit card payments are accepted on most places, some accept PayPal, as well. Keep in mind that in some occassions the price for the holiday you would choose might be a significant amount (especially when paying for more than one person). You might want to check your credit card limit and whether it will be sufficient or not. If you have concerns, you can ask the issuing bank to increase the limit, but this takes time. It is best if you could do it a month or two in advance.</p>

<p>There is one more thing you might want to check. Some websites release discount coupons regularly. Check which websites offer the holiday you are interested in and google for promo codes for the specific sites. I managed to find a 10% discount coupon for Hotels.com, which helped me save a significant amount of money.</p>

<p>This is it. Don&rsquo;t hesitate too long &ndash; choose an offer, pack your bags and godspeed!</p>

    <id>http://buynov.com/blog/2013/03/13/raspberry-pi-and-raspbmc-as-a-media-player</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>A Bit of Background</h3>

<p>I bought a TV set in the autumn (<a href="http://www.p4c.philips.com/cgi-bin/cpindex.pl?ctn=46PFL5537K/12">Philips 46PFL5537K/12</a>). It is a LED TV, with 3D (not that this matters), built-in WiFi, Smart TV, etc. The specs looked great and the price was quite acceptable. The picture, as a matter of fact, is very good &ndash; and thank God, because this is probably the most important thing about a TV. The software, however, is bad. Really bad. It appears as if it supports some standards, it appears to have some programmes and channels , but everything is so slow, clunky and poorly designed, that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be worth the effort. Without getting into too much details (and I am not familiar with them, simply because I lost interest pretty quickly), I&rsquo;ll just say that the media player built into the TV was not satisfying for me (it doesn&rsquo;t support any kind of subtitles in Cyrillic, for example) and I decided to get an external one. I quickly started leaning towards <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=330">WD Live</a>, probably the best choice if you compare price and capabilities. It didn&rsquo;t take long to decide and order it. Whether because it was around Christmas or for some other reason, it turned out that this model is not available anywhere. And no deliveries were expected shortly. Pretty amazing how you can order something online, from Amazon UK, for example, but you cannot get it from a local Sofia store, most likely because the local distributor is too lazy to make an order. Anyway.</p>

<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/RPi_front_small.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/RPi_front_small.jpg" alt="" /></a>Looking for an alternative, I decided to try the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> (or RPi for short) of a colleague. I took it for a weekend, installed <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/">RaspBMC</a>, connected it to a TV via HDMI cable and voila! It was working pretty well &ndash; several movies, pictures, everything was flawless. In exchange for 35 Euros (plus a couple of other things, see below) without VAT (if you heard the rumor of a $35 RPi, it is Europe after all ;)), I could assemble a media player, and a pretty good one. Additionally, Raspberry Pi (or RPi for short) is a fully functional computer, which you can use as a server &ndash; I read that some people host their Wordpress blog on it. Most RPi images are Debian-based (including the official <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> and <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/">RaspBMC</a>, which I prefer), so you have a bunch of packages ready to install.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h3>A Bit of Information About Raspberry Pi</h3>

<p>In case you don&rsquo;t know, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a cheap mini computer, developed by an independent foundation, initially targeted at children, who were supposed to play with them and grow an interest in the computer science as a whole. It turned out, however, that RPi became popular mainly among kids of 20-30 years of age, and its popularity contributed to having a couple of versions of the hardware already, and a huge potential to grow and be further developed in the upcoming years.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, though, that this is not a fully functional computer out of the box &ndash; the RPi itself is just a mainboard and in order to use it, you will need a micro USB charging cable, SD flash card (it helps if you consult <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards#Working_.2F_Non-working_SD_cards">this list</a> first) and an HDMI cable in order to connect it to a monitor or a TV set. You can also get additional accessories like a box, keyboard, mouse, WiFi adapter, etc. But before start extending the RPi, notice that some of those are highly overpriced &ndash; apparently some people / companies are trying to make easy money out of the popularity of the product, and its low price. Overall you should look at RPi as a construction computer kit, which requires &ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo; approach. If this sounds disturbing to you and you prefer everything to work out of the box, RPi is not for you.</p>

<h3><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/RPi_sideways_small.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/RPi_sideways_small.jpg" alt="" /></a>A Bit of Restrictions</h3>

<p>RPi has an ARM processor, which means that at this stage, you cannot install Windows on it. Microsoft already have an ARM based version of Windows (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_RT">Windows RT</a>), but I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone to get it going on a RPi, yet. And having in mind the serious requirements (for <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Surface-Windows-RT-Microsoft-windows-8,18536.html">disk space</a>, for example), this might never happen.</p>

<h3>A Bit of Logistics</h3>

<p>The RPi foundation granted exclusive right to only two official distributors world-wide &ndash; <a href="http://www.farnell.com/">Farnell</a> and <a href="http://www.rs-components.com">RS Components</a>. Lucky enough, one of those has an official representative in Bulgaria &ndash; namely, <a href="http://www.comet.bg/">Comet</a>. You can order an RPi from sites outside Bulgaria, (like Amazon DE/UK, for example), but it is not very likely that you will get it cheaper. I got my RPi from Comet, and I don&rsquo;t regret it. Their sales reps are very responsive &ndash; I had all the communication conducted over email and every time they responded within hours. They answered to all my questions and provided a final price before I place the order. Apart from the RPi itself, you can also order <a href="http://store.comet.bg/bg/CatalogueFarnell/Search/?keywords=raspberry#eyJpcHAiOiIxMCIsImsiOiJyYXNwYmVycnkifQ%3D%3D">all the accessories</a> that Farnell offers (keep in mind that Comet&rsquo;s search engine is a bit weird, and takes some time to provide results, without indicating that there is something going on in the background). If you order, you can have your items delivered by Speedy or Econt Express &ndash; about 10 leva for Sofia. for example. You can also pick-up your order from their office &ndash; they have one downtown Sofia. I also had a <a href="http://bg.farnell.com/multicomp/mc-rp001-clr/enclosure-raspberry-pi-clear/dp/2113799#">transparent box</a> delivered, which seems quite nice.</p>

<h3><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/xbmc_theater.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/xbmc_theater.jpg" alt="" /></a>A Little Media Player</h3>

<p>When you hear the word computer, usually you imagine basic peripherals like keyboard and mouse. In general, you can hook those up to the RPi, but with RaspBMC this is not required. RaspBMC is at its core a Debian with <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> as a user interface. The name of XBMC comes from XBox Media Center or to put it another way, a media player which resembles the interface of XBox. The software is quite mature and developed, the last version is 12, and it has been around for awhile. XBMC is open source software, and there are quite a few plugins and extensions for it. The best part of it is, that an XBMC instance can be controlled remotely in many different ways, including a web control panel (on RaspBMC it is enabled by default), smartphone applications (I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree">this one</a>, which is very good), and because it supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">DLNA</a> you can use any DLNA enabled remote controller, like <a href="http://www.imediashare.tv/">iMediaShare</a>, for example. In short, take the SD flash card from the RPi, install RaspBMC on a computer, put the SD card back in the RPi and power it up. Everything works great. Again, if installation, configuration and similar terms bother you, RPi is probably not for you. Check WD Live, it might already be available ;)</p>

<h3>A Bit of Extras</h3>

<p>With RaspBMC you get an important, although not very popular, library &ndash; <a href="http://libcec.pulse-eight.com/">libCEC</a>. It implements a standard protocol, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#CEC">CEC</a>, which I had no idea existed &ndash; a colleague of mine told me about it. This protocol allows you to control your XBMC with the standard remote control of your TV set, through the HDMI cable! And this works &hellip; to some extend. My colleague, for example, has a Sony TV set and this works without problems. You just switch the HDMI source from the TV menu, and you can control your XBMC with the TV remote, you don&rsquo;t need any other device. On my Philips TV, however, it&rsquo;s a different story. It only works from time to time. I think it is somewhat related to the fact, that I have another device on another HDMI port (the set-top box for the TV). The relation is not clear, though &ndash; sometimes the remote works when the TV box is turned on, other times &ndash; when turned off. So, if I want to &ldquo;wake&rdquo; the connection, I switch to the HDMI source of the RPi and start turning the TV box on and off &ndash; sometimes it works, sometimes not. If you have another TV model, however (like Sony, for example), it may work without problem.</p>

<p>Another great advantage of this configuration is that there are a lot of plugins for XBMC. You can find plugins available for a variety of services (including IPTV), and if you miss something, you can make it by yourself :)</p>

<p>If this is not enough for you, you have a fully-functional Linux box at your disposal, including SSH access (user: pi, password: raspberry &ndash; wise, right) with apt-get. With all the packages available for Debian, you can try to run anything you feel like.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Raspberry Pi with RaspBMC make for an excellent media player. The device is small, the software is stable and is being constantly developed. A colleague even managed to put the RPi on the back of his TV set and power it from the USB port of the TV, so that it wouldn&rsquo;t fool around. Additionally, after the success of the first two generations of RPi among the general public, you can expect the software to become better and better. Who knows, one day you might not even need your cable TV provider anymore ;).</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky.html">article</a> by <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/02/13.html">Joel Spolsky</a> reminded me of my introductory management class at the University. There is (only) one topic I vividly remember from this class &ndash; theories of human motivation.
Basically, there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_theory_Y">two</a> (well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_Z">three</a> if we have to be exact, but the third one applies mainly for Asia). The difference is mainly in the assumptions about people/employees:</p>

<p><strong>Theory X</strong></p>

<p>This theory assumes that employees are lazy, dislike work and would avoid it at any opportunity. Managers should not trust employees and micro-manage them at all times, to make sure they actually do something useful. Employees are going to work only when forced to do so, they should be blamed for any misstep, and their only interest in the job is money.
__</p>

<p><strong>Theory Y</strong></p>

<p>This theory assumes that people are willing to take initiative, when given the chance to do so, be self-motivated and do more than is expected from them. Under appropriate conditions, people would acknowledge responsibility and commitment for themselves, feel the need to achieve goals for the sole purpose of feeling satisfied by their own achievements.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>There are several parts of Joel&rsquo;s article that I liked &ndash; probably because of their defiant statements:</p>

<blockquote><p>Turns out, it’s positively de-motivating to work for a company where your job is just to shut up and take orders. In tech startup land, we all understand instinctively that we have to hire super smart people, but we forget that we then have to organize the workforce so that those people can use their brains 24/7.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The “management team” isn’t the “decision making” team. It’s a support function. You may want to call them administration instead of management, which will keep them from getting too big for their britches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Administrators aren’t supposed to make the hard decisions. They don’t know enough. All those super genius computer scientists that you had to recruit from MIT at great expense are supposed to make the hard decisions. That’s why you’re paying them&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky.html">The article</a> is worth it &ndash; I would advise you to read it.</p>

<p>P.S. Somewhat related to this topic &ndash; <a href="http://buynov.com/blog/2007/09/03/how-to-become-a-manager/">my thoughts</a> from several years back.</p>

The good news is that the bears are in Sofia until May, on the <a href="http://www.google.bg/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CDoQoAIwAw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmaps.google.bg%2Fmaps%2Fplace%3Fhl%3Dbg%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DYW3%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial%26channel%3Ds%26um%3D1%26ie%3DUTF-8%26q%3D%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%2B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%26fb%3D1%26gl%3Dbg%26hq%3D%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%2B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%26hnear%3D%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%26cid%3D14300161323953423416&amp;rct=j&amp;q=%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F&amp;ei=gV6jTemOMoPesgbH0oTfAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEl26M3dYVMCooe4tkgbV5DiMj-ZQ&amp;cad=rja">Sveta Nedelya</a> square, next to the church.</p>

<p>This is the full interview with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Rubin">Andy Rubin</a> from (already) last year&rsquo;s <a href="http://allthingsd.com/d/dive-into-mobile/">D: Dive Into Mobile</a> conference (I&rsquo;ve mentioned the <a href="http://allthingsd.com/">All Things Digital</a>&rsquo;s conferences <a href="http://buynov.com/blog/2010/06/08/steve-jobs-at-d8-the-full-interview/">before</a>).</p>

<p>Andy Rubin has two successful start-ups behind his back. One (the so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Sidekick">T-Mobile Sidekick</a>) he sold to Micro$soft, and the other (precisely, <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>) &ndash; to Google. This information, by itself, should tell enough.</p>

<p>The interview is long (about an hour and a half), but if you ask me, it&rsquo;s worthed. Enjoy!</p>

<p>The most interesting part is, that this thing is real &ndash; you can order it from <a href="http://www.johnsphones.com">here</a>. The price does not seem very real, but on the other hand the idea is quite innovative. iPhone does not seem that ingenious any more, does it <strong>;)</strong></p>

    <updated>2010-11-10T21:12:53+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://buynov.com/blog/2010/11/10/problems-and-solutions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2010/11/community.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2010/11/community-300x229.jpg" alt="Community" /></a></p>

<p>I went to the <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> website yesterday, to download the latest version (the JEE edition, if I have to be exact). I went to <a href="http://eclipse.org/home/categories/index.php?category=enterprise">Enterprise Java</a> &ndash;> <strong>Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers</strong> and the download started successfully, but I noticed that the file, that was being downloaded is old (not from the latest, Helios release). Thank God they put the release in the file name. I went to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Downloads</a> and managed to get the correct, latest version from there.</p>

<p>I wondered, however, what could be done to resolve the problem with the erroneous link. I remembered, that the Eclipse community maintains an issue-tracking system, <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/">Bugzilla</a>. I went there and filed a new bug report, <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=329827">329827</a>. Within about 15 minutes, the problem was resolved (see the timestamp difference between the first and the next to the last comment in the bug report).</p>

<p>Now, if you think about it, I could have done nothing. Not only that, but I could have grumbled around what idiots the guys at Eclipse are and how their site sucks big time and the links don&rsquo;t work. I pushed myself though, and did something else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you to deside which approach is better.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[iPad from Metro]]></title>
    <link href="http://buynov.com/blog/2010/09/03/ipad-from-metro/"/>
    <updated>2010-09-03T11:04:55+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://buynov.com/blog/2010/09/03/ipad-from-metro</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2010/09/iPad_v_Metro.png"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2010/09/iPad_v_Metro-242x300.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Unbelievable and yet, true &ndash; they are selling <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPads</a> in <a href="http://www.metro.bg">Metro</a>! If you don&rsquo;t believe it, check their <a href="http://metro.bg/pages/1102.aspx?0&amp;mm=10180&amp;cd=2&amp;kd=1&amp;pg=6">online catalogue</a> (you need a Metro card to be able to do so).</p>

<p> The price is not that impressive (keeping in mind that the same model of iPad sells for $499 in the US), but it is better than what <a href="http://laptopi-apple-i-pad-ot-notebook-bg.apple.laptopi.notebook.bg/laptop-apple-i-pad-16-gb-wi-fi/">others</a> are offering in Bulgaria. What impresses me most is that there is an Apple product on sale in a wholesale store like Metro.</p>

<p>If you like the offer, hurry up &ndash; it expires on Sep 8th. I suspect that the price will be higher after this date.</p>

<p>In this context, Apple announced the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> the other day. You can see the recording of the keynote <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2010/">here</a>. Even if you don&rsquo;t own any Apple product (like myself), Steve Jobs&#8217; presentations are always worth watching.</p>

    <link href="http://buynov.com/blog/2010/08/25/initialsetup-internetnetwork-applications/"/>
    <updated>2010-08-25T11:32:08+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://buynov.com/blog/2010/08/25/initialsetup-internetnetwork-applications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the USB stick I carry with me, I have a directory (called  InitialSetup) with software for Windows, which I update occasionally  (with new versions of the applications). I install the software each  time I do a new installation on my computer, or the computer of a  friend. These are applications, which I had used for awhile and am  pleased with their reliability. All of them are free, some are with open  source code. I will list those application in a series of 4 posts &ndash; I  hope they will be useful to you too.</p>

<p>I separated the software in the following four categories (thеse will be the names of the posts on the subject as well):</p>

<ol>
<li>. <a href="http://buynov.com/blog/2010/04/08/initialsetup-system-tools/"><strong>System tools</strong></a></li>
<li>. <strong>Internet/Network applications</strong><strong> </strong>(this post)</li>
<li>. <strong>Office applications/Tools for document (word) processing</strong></li>
<li>. <strong>Multimedia applications</strong></li>
</ol>


<hr />

<h3>Browsers</h3>

<p>There are at least three browsers, that are much better than <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx">Internet  Explorer</a> for several reasons. They are more secure (in the sense of  <strong>Security and Protection</strong> in the <a href="http://buynov.com/blog/2010/04/08/initialsetup-system-tools/">previous post</a> on the subject), they are  faster and they offer additional functionality to what IE has.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Firefox</a> </strong>&ndash; Internet Explorer&rsquo;s main competitor according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">usage  statistics</a> of the web browsers in the internet. Besides being quite fast  and reliable, Firefox is also famous for abiding official internet  standards (<a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>) most strictly. It is very useful,  that Firefox can be extended with a variety of add-ons, which improve  your internet (and not only) experience. You can install, for example,  status bar icons to notify you when you have new mail (without the need  to log into your email account every time you want to check it), block  Flash advertisements from the web sites you visit, to improve your Gmail  experience and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">a bunch</a> of other extensions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.opera.com/"><strong>Opera </strong></a>&ndash; Alongside the most popular mobile browser, <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mini</a>, Opera provide a desktop browser for quite some time. Very fast browser, the first one to introduce browsing in tabs (instead of different windows). This is a common feature for all modern browsers, but Opera made it first. The team behind Opera is known for their innovations, and they were the first to introduce the Speed Dial &ndash; when opening a new window/tab, the user is presented a preview of the most visited (or preconfigured) pages to choose from and go there fast. At present Google Chrome (and even Safari) provides the same functionality, but don&rsquo;t forget that Opera were first in this as well. Opera also offers add-ons (<a href="http://www.opera.com/widgets/">widgets</a>), but the choice is pretty limited, compared to what Firefox has to offer.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> &ndash; Google&rsquo;s browser slowly (but consistently) gains traction and is based on the same open source toolkit (<a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a>), used by Apple for their browser, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>. It also introduced <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">extensions</a> recently, which will make it even more popular. The curious thing about Chrome is, that it updates itself automatically (without asking the user) and each website is opened in e separate process &ndash; meaning that if one page you&rsquo;ve opened crashes, the rest are left intact.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.launchy.net/"><strong>Launchy</strong></a> &ndash; Launchy is not exactly a browser, but this seems the most appropriate category for it. I <a href="http://buynov.com/blog/2007/08/27/sourceforgenet-update-2007-08-24-edition/">mentioned</a> this extremely useful application before and to be honest, I&rsquo;ve been using it intensively ever since. A really useful tool for starting applications quickly, without having to look for them in the Start menu. Just press <strong>Alt + Space</strong>,  and start typing the name of the application you want to start and Launchy will suggest the programs it found. Try it if you haven&rsquo;t already &ndash; you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>Download Managers / Torrents</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.utorrent.com/">uTorrent</a> </strong>&ndash; Nowadays you don&rsquo;t have to be a &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; to use a torrent client. A number of web sites offer download of software through torrents, to reduce the load on their servers. uTorrent is really, really small (the installation file is only 300k!) and fast client, which does not exhaust much of your system&rsquo;s resources. At the same time it handles torrent downloads smoothly and efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vuze.com/"><strong>Azureus / Vuze</strong></a> &ndash; I had been using Azureus (long before it was renamed to Vuze) for quite awhile, before I came across uTorrent. The main reason I stopped using it, is that it is really, really sluggish &ndash; it loads very slowly and then you can feel it is working in the background (your whole PC becomes slower). Despite this shortcoming, it is one of the best torrent clients and handles torrent downloads wonderfully, even when other clients fail. They introduced media capabilities in Vuze recently, which will transform it in something like a Media Center (not just the next torrent client).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.downthemall.net/"><strong>DownThemAll!</strong></a> &ndash; Firefox add-on, which handles file downloads much better than the default download manager Firefox has built-in. It downloads files faster and supports resuming of downloads, if the connection is dropped, for example (and the server you are downloading from supports it). It also has a very useful <strong>dTa OneClick!</strong> function, which allows you to easily select directory for the download (from the most recent you&rsquo;ve used).</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>Instant Messengers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> </strong>&ndash; The most popular application for internet calls, which helped it become one of the most popular instant messaging clients, as well.  One of the main characteristics of Skype is, that the communication is secure. A message sent on Skype does not go through a central server and is encrypted, which makes it almost impossible for someone in the middle to read it. A drawback of this approach is, that if you send a message to someone, who is offline, she will receive the message only when you are both online again, at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.miranda-im.org/">Miranda</a> </strong>&ndash; Great little instant messaging client for Windows. You can use it for ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger and even  Jabber. It is really small, does not load your computer significantly and works fast and reliably. Until recently, it&rsquo;s major drawback was its ugly UI, but there are improvements on this front &ndash; there are better looking icons in the latest builds.</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>Remote Access</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://filezilla-project.org/"><strong>FileZilla</strong></a> &ndash; Great open source FTP client, localized in a variety of different languages, including Bulgarian.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"><strong>Putty</strong></a> &ndash; If you ever needed to access remote machines over SSH (Linux primarily), this is THE client for Windows. It&rsquo;s UI looks a bit outdated and clumsy, but it works great and once you get used to it, you stop worrying about it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://winscp.net"><strong>WinSCP</strong></a> &ndash; Very good client for file transfer over SCP or SFTP. The user interface reminds about Norton Commander and helps to transfer files to and from Linux/Unix machines easily and without hassle.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is different, in a way (a positive way) when there is a FIFA World Cup going on. It is good to know that there are three games each day, each of them having the potential to become <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249722/match=300061464/index.html">one</a> or <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249722/match=300061482/index.html">another</a> sensation. In regard to the World Cup is one of the best <a href="http://twitter.com/">tweets</a> I came across lately:</p>

<blockquote><p>The England team visited  an orphanage in Cape Town today. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heartbreaking to see their sad  little faces with no hope&rdquo; said Jamal aged 6.</p></blockquote>

<p>It might not be news, but just today I realized, that some of the TED presentations have subtitles. Including my mother tongue, Bulgarian!</p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorite videos, translated in Bulgarian (watch them, you won&rsquo;t regret it):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/lang/bul/david_pogue_says_simplicity_sells.html">Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/lang/bul/david_pogue_says_simplicity_sells.html">David Pogue says &ldquo;Simplicity sells&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/lang/bul/al_gore_on_averting_climate_crisis.html?ga_source=embed">Al Gore on averting climate crisis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/bul/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html">Dan Gilbert asks, Why are we happy?</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Here you can search TED videos by the subtitle languages, available for them:</p>

    <id>http://buynov.com/blog/2010/05/13/triumph-of-the-nerds</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115398/">Triumph of the Nerds</a>&#8220;  is a fascinating documentary about the dawn of personal computers and the people, who drove (and took advantage) of the process. Including Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Paul Allen, Larry Ellison, etc. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a> makes an appearance.</p>

<p>You can watch the movie on YouTube, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jV3JdtaOGc&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=4D5CD637F73C24C7&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=0&amp;playnext=1">here</a>, or to download it <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/5t5ruq">from here</a> (take a look at the comment&rsquo;s section below the movie in YouTube).</p>

<p>Scenes from this movie are among the most popular YouTube videos involving Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and are also used in movies like this 10 minute Steve Jobs documentary (keep in mind that the video is old, and the story does not include the release of the iPhone).</p>
