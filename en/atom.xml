    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>A Bit of Background</h3>

<p>I bought a TV set in the autumn (<a href="http://www.p4c.philips.com/cgi-bin/cpindex.pl?ctn=46PFL5537K/12">Philips 46PFL5537K/12</a>). It is a LED TV, with 3D (not that this matters), built-in WiFi, Smart TV, etc. The specs looked great and the price was quite acceptable. The picture, as a matter of fact, is very good &ndash; and thank God, because this is probably the most important thing about a TV. The software, however, is bad. Really bad. It appears as if it supports some standards, it appears to have some programmes and channels , but everything is so slow, clunky and poorly designed, that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be worth the effort. Without getting into too much details (and I am not familiar with them, simply because I lost interest pretty quickly), I&rsquo;ll just say that the media player built into the TV was not satisfying for me (it doesn&rsquo;t support any kind of subtitles in Cyrillic, for example) and I decided to get an external one. I quickly started leaning towards <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=330">WD Live</a>, probably the best choice if you compare price and capabilities. It didn&rsquo;t take long to decide and order it. Whether because it was around Christmas or for some other reason, it turned out that this model is not available anywhere. And no deliveries were expected shortly. Pretty amazing how you can order something online, from Amazon UK, for example, but you cannot get it from a local Sofia store, most likely because the local distributor is too lazy to make an order. Anyway.</p>

<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/RPi_front_small.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/RPi_front_small.jpg" alt="" /></a>Looking for an alternative, I decided to try the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> (or RPi for short) of a colleague. I took it for a weekend, installed <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/">RaspBMC</a>, connected it to a TV via HDMI cable and voila! It was working pretty well &ndash; several movies, pictures, everything was flawless. In exchange for 35 Euros (plus a couple of other things, see below) without VAT (if you heard the rumor of a $35 RPi, it is Europe after all ;)), I could assemble a media player, and a pretty good one. Additionally, Raspberry Pi (or RPi for short) is a fully functional computer, which you can use as a server &ndash; I read that some people host their Wordpress blog on it. Most RPi images are Debian-based (including the official <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> and <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/">RaspBMC</a>, which I prefer), so you have a bunch of packages ready to install.</p>

<h3>A Bit of Information About Raspberry Pi</h3>

<p>In case you don&rsquo;t know, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a cheap mini computer, developed by an independent foundation, initially targeted at children, who were supposed to play with them and grow an interest in the computer science as a whole. It turned out, however, that RPi became popular mainly among kids of 20-30 years of age, and its popularity contributed to having a couple of versions of the hardware already, and a huge potential to grow and be further developed in the upcoming years.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, though, that this is not a fully functional computer out of the box &ndash; the RPi itself is just a mainboard and in order to use it, you will need a micro USB charging cable, SD flash card (it helps if you consult <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards#Working_.2F_Non-working_SD_cards">this list</a> first) and an HDMI cable in order to connect it to a monitor or a TV set. You can also get additional accessories like a box, keyboard, mouse, WiFi adapter, etc. But before start extending the RPi, notice that some of those are highly overpriced &ndash; apparently some people / companies are trying to make easy money out of the popularity of the product, and its low price. Overall you should look at RPi as a construction computer kit, which requires &ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo; approach. If this sounds disturbing to you and you prefer everything to work out of the box, RPi is not for you.</p>

<h3><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/RPi_sideways_small.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/RPi_sideways_small.jpg" alt="" /></a>A Bit of Restrictions</h3>

<p>RPi has an ARM processor, which means that at this stage, you cannot install Windows on it. Microsoft already have an ARM based version of Windows (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_RT">Windows RT</a>), but I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone to get it going on a RPi, yet. And having in mind the serious requirements (for <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Surface-Windows-RT-Microsoft-windows-8,18536.html">disk space</a>, for example), this might never happen.</p>

<h3>A Bit of Logistics</h3>

<p>The RPi foundation granted exclusive right to only two official distributors world-wide &ndash; <a href="http://www.farnell.com/">Farnell</a> and <a href="http://www.rs-components.com">RS Components</a>. Lucky enough, one of those has an official representative in Bulgaria &ndash; namely, <a href="http://www.comet.bg/">Comet</a>. You can order an RPi from sites outside Bulgaria, (like Amazon DE/UK, for example), but it is not very likely that you will get it cheaper. I got my RPi from Comet, and I don&rsquo;t regret it. Their sales reps are very responsive &ndash; I had all the communication conducted over email and every time they responded within hours. They answered to all my questions and provided a final price before I place the order. Apart from the RPi itself, you can also order <a href="http://store.comet.bg/bg/CatalogueFarnell/Search/?keywords=raspberry#eyJpcHAiOiIxMCIsImsiOiJyYXNwYmVycnkifQ%3D%3D">all the accessories</a> that Farnell offers (keep in mind that Comet&rsquo;s search engine is a bit weird, and takes some time to provide results, without indicating that there is something going on in the background). If you order, you can have your items delivered by Speedy or Econt Express &ndash; about 10 leva for Sofia. for example. You can also pick-up your order from their office &ndash; they have one downtown Sofia. I also had a <a href="http://bg.farnell.com/multicomp/mc-rp001-clr/enclosure-raspberry-pi-clear/dp/2113799#">transparent box</a> delivered, which seems quite nice.</p>

<h3><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/xbmc_theater.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2013/03/xbmc_theater.jpg" alt="" /></a>A Little Media Player</h3>

<p>When you hear the word computer, usually you imagine basic peripherals like keyboard and mouse. In general, you can hook those up to the RPi, but with RaspBMC this is not required. RaspBMC is at its core a Debian with <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> as a user interface. The name of XBMC comes from XBox Media Center or to put it another way, a media player which resembles the interface of XBox. The software is quite mature and developed, the last version is 12, and it has been around for awhile. XBMC is open source software, and there are quite a few plugins and extensions for it. The best part of it is, that an XBMC instance can be controlled remotely in many different ways, including a web control panel (on RaspBMC it is enabled by default), smartphone applications (I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree">this one</a>, which is very good), and because it supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">DLNA</a> you can use any DLNA enabled remote controller, like <a href="http://www.imediashare.tv/">iMediaShare</a>, for example. In short, take the SD flash card from the RPi, install RaspBMC on a computer, put the SD card back in the RPi and power it up. Everything works great. Again, if installation, configuration and similar terms bother you, RPi is probably not for you. Check WD Live, it might already be available ;)</p>

<h3>A Bit of Extras</h3>

<p>With RaspBMC you get an important, although not very popular, library &ndash; <a href="http://libcec.pulse-eight.com/">libCEC</a>. It implements a standard protocol, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#CEC">CEC</a>, which I had no idea existed &ndash; a colleague of mine told me about it. This protocol allows you to control your XBMC with the standard remote control of your TV set, through the HDMI cable! And this works &hellip; to some extend. My colleague, for example, has a Sony TV set and this works without problems. You just switch the HDMI source from the TV menu, and you can control your XBMC with the TV remote, you don&rsquo;t need any other device. On my Philips TV, however, it&rsquo;s a different story. It only works from time to time. I think it is somewhat related to the fact, that I have another device on another HDMI port (the set-top box for the TV). The relation is not clear, though &ndash; sometimes the remote works when the TV box is turned on, other times &ndash; when turned off. So, if I want to &ldquo;wake&rdquo; the connection, I switch to the HDMI source of the RPi and start turning the TV box on and off &ndash; sometimes it works, sometimes not. If you have another TV model, however (like Sony, for example), it may work without problem.</p>

<p>Another great advantage of this configuration is that there are a lot of plugins for XBMC. You can find plugins available for a variety of services (including IPTV), and if you miss something, you can make it by yourself :)</p>

<p>If this is not enough for you, you have a fully-functional Linux box at your disposal, including SSH access (user: pi, password: raspberry &ndash; wise, right) with apt-get. With all the packages available for Debian, you can try to run anything you feel like.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Raspberry Pi with RaspBMC make for an excellent media player. The device is small, the software is stable and is being constantly developed. A colleague even managed to put the RPi on the back of his TV set and power it from the USB port of the TV, so that it wouldn&rsquo;t fool around. Additionally, after the success of the first two generations of RPi among the general public, you can expect the software to become better and better. Who knows, one day you might not even need your cable TV provider anymore ;).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2012/02/motivation.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2012/02/motivation.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky.html">article</a> by <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/02/13.html">Joel Spolsky</a> reminded me of my introductory management class at the University. There is (only) one topic I vividly remember from this class &ndash; theories of human motivation.
Basically, there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_theory_Y">two</a> (well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_Z">three</a> if we have to be exact, but the third one applies mainly for Asia). The difference is mainly in the assumptions about people/employees:</p>

<p><strong>Theory X</strong></p>

<p>This theory assumes that employees are lazy, dislike work and would avoid it at any opportunity. Managers should not trust employees and micro-manage them at all times, to make sure they actually do something useful. Employees are going to work only when forced to do so, they should be blamed for any misstep, and their only interest in the job is money.
__</p>

<p><strong>Theory Y</strong></p>

<p>This theory assumes that people are willing to take initiative, when given the chance to do so, be self-motivated and do more than is expected from them. Under appropriate conditions, people would acknowledge responsibility and commitment for themselves, feel the need to achieve goals for the sole purpose of feeling satisfied by their own achievements.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>There are several parts of Joel&rsquo;s article that I liked &ndash; probably because of their defiant statements:</p>

<blockquote><p>Turns out, it’s positively de-motivating to work for a company where your job is just to shut up and take orders. In tech startup land, we all understand instinctively that we have to hire super smart people, but we forget that we then have to organize the workforce so that those people can use their brains 24/7.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The “management team” isn’t the “decision making” team. It’s a support function. You may want to call them administration instead of management, which will keep them from getting too big for their britches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Administrators aren’t supposed to make the hard decisions. They don’t know enough. All those super genius computer scientists that you had to recruit from MIT at great expense are supposed to make the hard decisions. That’s why you’re paying them&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky.html">The article</a> is worth it &ndash; I would advise you to read it.</p>

<p>P.S. Somewhat related to this topic &ndash; <a href="http://buynov.com/blog/2007/09/03/how-to-become-a-manager/">my thoughts</a> from several years back.</p>

<p>Andy Rubin has two successful start-ups behind his back. One (the so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Sidekick">T-Mobile Sidekick</a>) he sold to Micro$soft, and the other (precisely, <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>) &ndash; to Google. This information, by itself, should tell enough.</p>

<p>The interview is long (about an hour and a half), but if you ask me, it&rsquo;s worthed. Enjoy!</p>

<p>The most interesting part is, that this thing is real &ndash; you can order it from <a href="http://www.johnsphones.com">here</a>. The price does not seem very real, but on the other hand the idea is quite innovative. iPhone does not seem that ingenious any more, does it <strong>;)</strong></p>

    <id>http://buynov.com/blog/2010/11/10/problems-and-solutions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2010/11/community.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2010/11/community-300x229.jpg" alt="Community" /></a></p>

<p>I went to the <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> website yesterday, to download the latest version (the JEE edition, if I have to be exact). I went to <a href="http://eclipse.org/home/categories/index.php?category=enterprise">Enterprise Java</a> &ndash;> <strong>Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers</strong> and the download started successfully, but I noticed that the file, that was being downloaded is old (not from the latest, Helios release). Thank God they put the release in the file name. I went to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Downloads</a> and managed to get the correct, latest version from there.</p>

<p>I wondered, however, what could be done to resolve the problem with the erroneous link. I remembered, that the Eclipse community maintains an issue-tracking system, <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/">Bugzilla</a>. I went there and filed a new bug report, <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=329827">329827</a>. Within about 15 minutes, the problem was resolved (see the timestamp difference between the first and the next to the last comment in the bug report).</p>

<p>Now, if you think about it, I could have done nothing. Not only that, but I could have grumbled around what idiots the guys at Eclipse are and how their site sucks big time and the links don&rsquo;t work. I pushed myself though, and did something else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you to deside which approach is better.</p>

    <link href="http://buynov.com/blog/2010/09/03/ipad-from-metro/"/>
    <updated>2010-09-03T11:04:55+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://buynov.com/blog/2010/09/03/ipad-from-metro</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2010/09/iPad_v_Metro.png"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2010/09/iPad_v_Metro-242x300.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Unbelievable and yet, true &ndash; they are selling <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPads</a> in <a href="http://www.metro.bg">Metro</a>! If you don&rsquo;t believe it, check their <a href="http://metro.bg/pages/1102.aspx?0&amp;mm=10180&amp;cd=2&amp;kd=1&amp;pg=6">online catalogue</a> (you need a Metro card to be able to do so).</p>

<p> The price is not that impressive (keeping in mind that the same model of iPad sells for $499 in the US), but it is better than what <a href="http://laptopi-apple-i-pad-ot-notebook-bg.apple.laptopi.notebook.bg/laptop-apple-i-pad-16-gb-wi-fi/">others</a> are offering in Bulgaria. What impresses me most is that there is an Apple product on sale in a wholesale store like Metro.</p>

<p>If you like the offer, hurry up &ndash; it expires on Sep 8th. I suspect that the price will be higher after this date.</p>

<p>In this context, Apple announced the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> the other day. You can see the recording of the keynote <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2010/">here</a>. Even if you don&rsquo;t own any Apple product (like myself), Steve Jobs&#8217; presentations are always worth watching.</p>

    <link href="http://buynov.com/blog/2010/08/25/initialsetup-internetnetwork-applications/"/>
    <updated>2010-08-25T11:32:08+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://buynov.com/blog/2010/08/25/initialsetup-internetnetwork-applications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the USB stick I carry with me, I have a directory (called  InitialSetup) with software for Windows, which I update occasionally  (with new versions of the applications). I install the software each  time I do a new installation on my computer, or the computer of a  friend. These are applications, which I had used for awhile and am  pleased with their reliability. All of them are free, some are with open  source code. I will list those application in a series of 4 posts &ndash; I  hope they will be useful to you too.</p>

<p>I separated the software in the following four categories (thеse will be the names of the posts on the subject as well):</p>

<ol>
<li>. <a href="http://buynov.com/blog/2010/04/08/initialsetup-system-tools/"><strong>System tools</strong></a></li>
<li>. <strong>Internet/Network applications</strong><strong> </strong>(this post)</li>
<li>. <strong>Office applications/Tools for document (word) processing</strong></li>
<li>. <strong>Multimedia applications</strong></li>
</ol>


<hr />

<h3>Browsers</h3>

<p>There are at least three browsers, that are much better than <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx">Internet  Explorer</a> for several reasons. They are more secure (in the sense of  <strong>Security and Protection</strong> in the <a href="http://buynov.com/blog/2010/04/08/initialsetup-system-tools/">previous post</a> on the subject), they are  faster and they offer additional functionality to what IE has.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Firefox</a> </strong>&ndash; Internet Explorer&rsquo;s main competitor according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">usage  statistics</a> of the web browsers in the internet. Besides being quite fast  and reliable, Firefox is also famous for abiding official internet  standards (<a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>) most strictly. It is very useful,  that Firefox can be extended with a variety of add-ons, which improve  your internet (and not only) experience. You can install, for example,  status bar icons to notify you when you have new mail (without the need  to log into your email account every time you want to check it), block  Flash advertisements from the web sites you visit, to improve your Gmail  experience and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">a bunch</a> of other extensions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.opera.com/"><strong>Opera </strong></a>&ndash; Alongside the most popular mobile browser, <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mini</a>, Opera provide a desktop browser for quite some time. Very fast browser, the first one to introduce browsing in tabs (instead of different windows). This is a common feature for all modern browsers, but Opera made it first. The team behind Opera is known for their innovations, and they were the first to introduce the Speed Dial &ndash; when opening a new window/tab, the user is presented a preview of the most visited (or preconfigured) pages to choose from and go there fast. At present Google Chrome (and even Safari) provides the same functionality, but don&rsquo;t forget that Opera were first in this as well. Opera also offers add-ons (<a href="http://www.opera.com/widgets/">widgets</a>), but the choice is pretty limited, compared to what Firefox has to offer.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> &ndash; Google&rsquo;s browser slowly (but consistently) gains traction and is based on the same open source toolkit (<a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a>), used by Apple for their browser, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>. It also introduced <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">extensions</a> recently, which will make it even more popular. The curious thing about Chrome is, that it updates itself automatically (without asking the user) and each website is opened in e separate process &ndash; meaning that if one page you&rsquo;ve opened crashes, the rest are left intact.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.launchy.net/"><strong>Launchy</strong></a> &ndash; Launchy is not exactly a browser, but this seems the most appropriate category for it. I <a href="http://buynov.com/blog/2007/08/27/sourceforgenet-update-2007-08-24-edition/">mentioned</a> this extremely useful application before and to be honest, I&rsquo;ve been using it intensively ever since. A really useful tool for starting applications quickly, without having to look for them in the Start menu. Just press <strong>Alt + Space</strong>,  and start typing the name of the application you want to start and Launchy will suggest the programs it found. Try it if you haven&rsquo;t already &ndash; you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>Download Managers / Torrents</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.utorrent.com/">uTorrent</a> </strong>&ndash; Nowadays you don&rsquo;t have to be a &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; to use a torrent client. A number of web sites offer download of software through torrents, to reduce the load on their servers. uTorrent is really, really small (the installation file is only 300k!) and fast client, which does not exhaust much of your system&rsquo;s resources. At the same time it handles torrent downloads smoothly and efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vuze.com/"><strong>Azureus / Vuze</strong></a> &ndash; I had been using Azureus (long before it was renamed to Vuze) for quite awhile, before I came across uTorrent. The main reason I stopped using it, is that it is really, really sluggish &ndash; it loads very slowly and then you can feel it is working in the background (your whole PC becomes slower). Despite this shortcoming, it is one of the best torrent clients and handles torrent downloads wonderfully, even when other clients fail. They introduced media capabilities in Vuze recently, which will transform it in something like a Media Center (not just the next torrent client).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.downthemall.net/"><strong>DownThemAll!</strong></a> &ndash; Firefox add-on, which handles file downloads much better than the default download manager Firefox has built-in. It downloads files faster and supports resuming of downloads, if the connection is dropped, for example (and the server you are downloading from supports it). It also has a very useful <strong>dTa OneClick!</strong> function, which allows you to easily select directory for the download (from the most recent you&rsquo;ve used).</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>Instant Messengers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> </strong>&ndash; The most popular application for internet calls, which helped it become one of the most popular instant messaging clients, as well.  One of the main characteristics of Skype is, that the communication is secure. A message sent on Skype does not go through a central server and is encrypted, which makes it almost impossible for someone in the middle to read it. A drawback of this approach is, that if you send a message to someone, who is offline, she will receive the message only when you are both online again, at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.miranda-im.org/">Miranda</a> </strong>&ndash; Great little instant messaging client for Windows. You can use it for ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger and even  Jabber. It is really small, does not load your computer significantly and works fast and reliably. Until recently, it&rsquo;s major drawback was its ugly UI, but there are improvements on this front &ndash; there are better looking icons in the latest builds.</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>Remote Access</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://filezilla-project.org/"><strong>FileZilla</strong></a> &ndash; Great open source FTP client, localized in a variety of different languages, including Bulgarian.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"><strong>Putty</strong></a> &ndash; If you ever needed to access remote machines over SSH (Linux primarily), this is THE client for Windows. It&rsquo;s UI looks a bit outdated and clumsy, but it works great and once you get used to it, you stop worrying about it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://winscp.net"><strong>WinSCP</strong></a> &ndash; Very good client for file transfer over SCP or SFTP. The user interface reminds about Norton Commander and helps to transfer files to and from Linux/Unix machines easily and without hassle.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is different, in a way (a positive way) when there is a FIFA World Cup going on. It is good to know that there are three games each day, each of them having the potential to become <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249722/match=300061464/index.html">one</a> or <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249722/match=300061482/index.html">another</a> sensation. In regard to the World Cup is one of the best <a href="http://twitter.com/">tweets</a> I came across lately:</p>

<blockquote><p>The England team visited  an orphanage in Cape Town today. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heartbreaking to see their sad  little faces with no hope&rdquo; said Jamal aged 6.</p></blockquote>

<p>It might not be news, but just today I realized, that some of the TED presentations have subtitles. Including my mother tongue, Bulgarian!</p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorite videos, translated in Bulgarian (watch them, you won&rsquo;t regret it):</p>

    <updated>2010-05-13T08:36:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://buynov.com/blog/2010/05/13/triumph-of-the-nerds</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115398/">Triumph of the Nerds</a>&#8220;  is a fascinating documentary about the dawn of personal computers and the people, who drove (and took advantage) of the process. Including Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Paul Allen, Larry Ellison, etc. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a> makes an appearance.</p>

<p>You can watch the movie on YouTube, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jV3JdtaOGc&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=4D5CD637F73C24C7&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=0&amp;playnext=1">here</a>, or to download it <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/5t5ruq">from here</a> (take a look at the comment&rsquo;s section below the movie in YouTube).</p>

<p>Scenes from this movie are among the most popular YouTube videos involving Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and are also used in movies like this 10 minute Steve Jobs documentary (keep in mind that the video is old, and the story does not include the release of the iPhone).</p>

<p>Model: <strong><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_ga_628-105.php">Ericsson GA-628</a></strong></p>

<p>Year: <strong>1998</strong></p>

<p>I got it with a pre-paid SIM card from <a href="http://online.vodafone.co.uk/">Vodafone UK</a>. Not that I could afford it, but I just couldn&rsquo;t resist. Ericsson were among the leaders in mobile phone manufacturers at the time, and the GA-628 had the stunning <strong>two-row</strong> display (no one was considering pixels at that time).</p>

<p>I used the phone for about a month and after I got back to Bulgaria, I tried to sell it. I realized then, that cell-phones could be locked, and in order to work with networks different than the network of the operator you got it from, you must find someone to unlock it. In exchange for a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; charge, of course. This adventure cost me dearly, at the end, but it was really cool to have a cell-phone at that time.</p>

<p>Model: <strong><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_talkabout_t2288-82.php">Motorola T2288</a></strong></p>

<p>Year: <strong>2000</strong></p>

<p>A friend of mine brought it to me from Germany. I was well aware of the unlocking, already, and this time is cost me only 15 leva (about 7.5 EURO). I clearly remember, that when I got the phone, I stood in line for half a day to get a SIM card from the only mobile carrier in Bulgaria at the time, <a href="http://mtel.net">Mobiltel</a>. The phone was not something special, but it was good enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/03_Nokia_7110.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/03_Nokia_7110.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Model: <strong><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7110-15.php">Nokia 7110</a></strong></p>

<p>Year: <strong>2002</strong></p>

<p>I got it second hand &ndash; I simply didn&rsquo;t have the money to get it brand new. Additionally, the model was kind of dated already &ndash; it had been two-three years since it was released (in 1999). The guy who sold it to me had just gotten a brand new <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6310-240.php">Nokia  6310</a> and therefore wanted to sell the 7110. I nobly envied him, for being able to afford it.</p>

<p>Otherwise the 7110 by itself was a pretty good phone. A lot of people think, that this model was featured in the phenomenal first part of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>&rdquo; (you remember, the package Neo got while being in the office, with a cell-phone inside it) &ndash; this is not true. They used a <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_8110-11.php">8110</a> there.</p>

<p>I remember that this was the first phone, that I could upload ring-tones to. There were also internet sites, you could send a ring-tone through &ndash; some of them were even free.</p>

<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/04_SonyEricsson_P800.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/04_SonyEricsson_P800.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Model: <strong><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_p800-326.php">Sony Ericsson P800</a></strong></p>

<p>Year: <strong>2004</strong></p>

<p>An extraordinary phone, one of the first true smart-phones.As a matter of fact, I went to the store determined to buy the new <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6600-454.php">Nokia  6600</a>, but when I saw the P800, I just couldn&rsquo;t help it. The presentation of the device included an advertising video, played on the phone itself. And after you play a bit with the touch screen, you are hooked &ndash; and several hundred leva poorer. In fact, the video playback was not a trick &ndash; I&rsquo;ve had full length movies that I could watch on the device without a problem.</p>

<p>A truly unique device, for its time. I had a whole DVD stuffed with software for the P800 I found on the net &ndash; there was a SEGA emulator (so that you could play SEGA games directly on your device), VNC client (true, you could only see about 5% of the desktop, but still &hellip;), SSH client and so forth, and so on. Amazing device.</p>

<p>Almost forgot &ndash; this is one of the first Symbian phones on the market. Just to remind you &ndash; Nokia released their first ever Symbian touch-screen phone in 2008, while P800 was released in 2002.</p>

<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/05_SonyEricsson_K750i.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/05_SonyEricsson_K750i.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Model: <strong><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_k750-1090.php">Sony Ericsson K750i</a></strong></p>

<p>Year: <strong>2006</strong></p>

<p>Another magnificent specimen from Sony Ericsson&rsquo;s shelf. Not that &ldquo;smart&rdquo; this time, but a wonderful phone nevertheless. What astounded me is how easy I got used to the phone and how much I liked the well designed user interface. Sony Ericsson had the metaphore of notification bar already at the time, which currently exists in Android &ndash; when you press the button right on top of the joystick, a screen showed up with all events, alarms, calls, etc. you missed.</p>

<p>This is the first phone I tried <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mini</a> on, and it worked perfectly. Excellent phone.</p>

<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/06_Nokia_E66.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/06_Nokia_E66.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Model: <strong><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_e66-2426.php">Nokia E66</a></strong></p>

<p>Year: <strong>2008</strong></p>

<p>Huge disappointment. I was unable to get it &ndash; how did Nokia expect that someone would buy a smart-phone from their enterprise series (Exx) and will be pleased with it, when the battery drains each and every day. I couldn&rsquo;t determine the reason, but even if I only speak 2-3 times per day and do almost nothing else with the phone, the battery was dead after a day and a half tops. And believe me, I tried &ndash; fully charge the phone, run a task manager and kill all the tasks that don&rsquo;t seem useful and nevertheless, the phone was dead in a day or so. The battery was fully discharged. Ridiculous. Add the ancient S60 interface on top of that and there you go &ndash; enormous disappointment.</p>

<p>Having said all that, the phone&rsquo;s build quality was not bad at all &ndash; the device was solid and it was obvious, that it is of high build quality. I dropper it several times (on asphalt, pavement, etc.) &ndash; it didn&rsquo;t even had a scratch. The sliding mechanism was also excellent. The web browser was not bad, as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/07_HTC_Magic.jpg"><img src="http://buynov.com/images/2010/04/07_HTC_Magic.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Model: <strong><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_magic-2714.php">HTC  Magic</a></strong></p>

<p>Year: <strong>2009</strong></p>

<p>There is a lot to be desired from the HTC Magic, but keep in mind that this is just about the second Android phone out there. At one time I was really mad at HTC, because the original software was really slow and was annoying me day after day, but then I decided to experiment with the custom made ROMs from <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=493">XDA  Developers</a> and I am really glad I did so. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Sense">HTC Sense</a> really changes your phone and breathes it a new life. If you have an Android device, make sure you get Sense on it &ndash; it is extremely good.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://buynov.com/2009/09/24/440">wrote about the Magic</a> before, so I won&rsquo;t get into details here.</p>

<p>Stop wondering. Prepare your own mobile biography and post the link as a comment.</p>

<p>P.S. I &ldquo;stole&rdquo; the idea from <a href="http://www.paxmodept.com/telesto/blogitem.htm?id=809">here</a>.</p>
