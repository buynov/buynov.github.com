  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/en/images/2010/04/iPhoneOS4.jpg"><img src="/en/images/2010/04/iPhoneOS4.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Last Thursday, on Apr 08, Steve Jobs and <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/forstall.html">Scott Forstall</a> presented the plans for the new iPhone operating system, <strong>iPhone  OS 4</strong>. The event itself can be seen on the <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1004fk8d5gt/event/">official site</a>. What are the highlights?</p>

<h2><strong>Multi-tasking</strong></h2>

<p>The purpose of multitasking is simple &ndash; to be able to run several applications concurrently. To be able to play some music, for example, and while listening to it to browse the internet, or write an SMS, or do something else. Or to run Skype and do other stuff until someone writes you a Skype message or initiates a Skype call. In iPhone this is currently impossible &ndash; if you start a program, it is the only one running, and in order to start another one, you will have to close the first. If you run Skype, it is the only application running and if you want to google something, for example, you must close Skype and run the browser. That&rsquo;s it, these are the rules. For everyone. Except for Apple&rsquo;s applications, of course.</p>

<p>This is a subject Apple&rsquo;s been criticized about for years (literally) and now, with the release of iPhone OS 4, it is expected to change. From what I saw on Steve Jobs&rsquo;s presentation, however, it is not likely that the iPhone multitasking will be anywhere close to what we are used to in other platforms (in terms of capabilities it gives the developers), but it is still something. As a matter of fact, the popularity of the iPhone (about 50 million devices sold in around three years time), without multitasking furthermore suggests, that this is not something you can&rsquo;t live without. And Apple are so concerned that the multitasking could harm the battery life or the performance of the device, that the seven services for multitasking that are available on the iPhone, they implemented themselves (which is not such a bad idea, if you think about it for awhile).</p>

<p>I find Steve Jobs&rsquo;s comment about the question how iPhone multitasking applications can be stopped interesting &ndash; <em>&ldquo;if you see a task manager&hellip; they blew it. Users shouldn&rsquo;t ever have to think about it.&rdquo;</em> (you can follow the Q&amp;A section, that took place after the presentation at the end of the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/08/live-from-apples-iphone-os-4-event/?sort=oldest&amp;refresh=0&amp;lan=english">Engadget&rsquo;s live post</a>). He commented in a similar manner the need of a stylus for touch-screen devices on the initial launch of the iPhone &ndash; do you recall the last time you noticed a release of a modern smart-phone with a stylus? He might just be right again.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Multi-marketing&rdquo;</h2>

<p>The purpose of &ldquo;multimarketing&rdquo; is simple &ndash; to be able to release a product on several &ldquo;markets&rdquo; concurrently. To release the iPhone as a mass market mobile phone, for example, and at the same time to release it as a competitive offering for businesses, as a gaming console and as a digital book reader. All at once &ndash; in one product, one device. To see what I have in mind, read on.</p>

<p><strong>iPhone as a <em>(BlackBerry?)</em> business phone</strong></p>

<p>There are three characteristics that lead to BlackBerry&rsquo;s <a href="http://comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2010/4/comScore_Reports_February_2010_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share">dominance as a most popular mobile platform in the US</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Secure (encrypted) communication &ndash; </strong>Every connection the BlackBerry device initiates to the BlackBerry server is encrypted. This means in practice, that nobody can &ldquo;spy&rdquo; your communication while you work on the mobile device. One of the new features of the iPhone OS 4, is that all incoming/outgoing iPhone email messages are encrypted, similarly to what BlackBerry/RIM are doing.</li>
<li><strong>Push email</strong> &ndash; Means that you receive your email messages on your BlackBerry device the moment they arrive in your Inbox. No delays, everything happens instantly. Additionally, the technology allows to improve the performance of the mobile device, because it doesn&rsquo;t need to check if there is a new email message every 5 minutes (for example). iPhone has push email support for more than a year (I am not sure if it requires MS Exchange or not, though).</li>
<li><strong>Centralized device management </strong>&ndash; Likewise to what BlackBerry devices have, Apple will allow remote, centralized mobile device management. In the BlackBerry world this means the company administrators could, for example, install applications on company handsets without any user interaction. Another possibility is to disallow application installations for programs that the company did not authorize for use.</li>
</ul>


<p>Keeping in mind the growth of revenue RIM are enjoying during the last couple of years, this might be a good attempt to attract at least some of the BlackBerry business users.</p>

<p><strong>iPhone as a <em>(XBox?)</em> gaming console</strong></p>

<p>There are games for iPhone since the very beginning, like in almost all mobile devices. New in iPhone OS 4, however, is the social gaming network, called Game Center. According to people who are familiar with the subject (I am not one of those), the good implementation of the XBox Live platform for online gaming is the main reason for the success of XBox 360. Well, apparently Apple are trying to do the same. And it is definitely not accidental that Steve Jobs compared the iPhone with another two popular, portable gaming consoles like <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/ds/systems">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href="http://uk.playstation.com/psp/">Sony PSP</a>.</p>

<p><strong>iPhone as a <em>(Kindle?)</em> digital book reader</strong></p>

<p>Apple released <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8">iBooks</a> with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a>, and now the application (iBooks) will also be available for the iPhone. This is a direct attack towards the users of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle">Kindle from Amazon</a>, which by the way, already has an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000301301">iPhone application</a>.</p>

<p><strong>iPhone as a <em>(Google Ads?)</em> platform for online advertising</strong></p>

<p>According to Steve Jobs the online advertising, which is currently mostly effective for internet search engines (yes, Google) will transform in advertising for mobile applications (but not for mobile search). Currently a leader in this segment is <a href="http://www.admob.com/">AdMob</a>,  who were recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/11/09/google-acquires-admob/">acquired by Google</a>. And although the demo of the capabilities of iAd seems quite impressive, I seriously doubt that this will be the case with the regular adverts in iAd. They will probably look like the ones on AdMob/Google.</p>

<p>The new operating system will be available for the users of iPhone in the summer, and for iPad users in the fall. Not all new features will be available for the 1st and 2nd generation iPhones &ndash; multitasking will be missing, for example,  &ldquo;due to hardware limitations&rdquo;.</p>

<time datetime="2010-04-08T08:38:18+03:00" pubdate data-updated="true">08 Apr 2010</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the USB stick I carry with me, I have a directory (called InitialSetup) with software for Windows, which I update occasionally (with new versions of the applications). I install the software each time I do a new installation on my computer, or the computer of a friend. These are applications, which I had used for awhile and I was pleased with their reliability. All of them are free, some are with open source code. I will list those application in a series of 4 posts &ndash; I hope they will be useful to you too.</p>

<p>I separated the software in the following four categories (thеse will be the names of the posts on the subject as well):</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>System tools </strong>(this post)</li>
<li> <strong><a href="/en/blog/2010/08/25/initialsetup-internetnetwork-applications/">Internet/Network applications</a></strong></li>
<li> <strong>Office applications/Tools for document (word) processing</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Multimedia applications</strong></li>
</ol>


<h3>Security and protection</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://free-av.com/">Avira  AntiVir</a></strong> &ndash; Anti-virus software, free for non-commercial use. I use it for a very long time and by far I got a virus only once (quite some time ago). Very reliable and one of the few anti-virus packages to be able to co-exist with another anti-virus software (not that you need one).</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.spybot.com">Spybot  Search &amp; Destroy</a></strong> &ndash; Software for protection from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware">spyware</a>. In general, spyware are malicious programs that collect personal information and can enable a break into your computer.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you doubt that the security of your PC is compromised, use these two products &ndash; the chance that you will be able to resolve the problem is pretty big. Well, it stil depends on how negligent you were and how far you allowed the malicious software to reach into your machine &ndash; sometimes the re-install of Windows is still the only option.</p>

<h3>Archiver</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a></strong> &ndash; Forget about <a href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZIP</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.  This is a wonderful, free archiver with open source code and with a Bulgarian localization. It supports unpacking of (almost) any popular format, namely ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, DEB, DMG, HFS, ISO,  LZH, LZMA, MSI, NSIS, RAR, RPM, UDF, WIM, XAR and Z. It can create archives in 7z, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2 and TAR formats, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7z">7z</a> is own format, which provides significantly improved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip">ZIP</a> compression, similar to the level of compression of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR">RAR</a>. Keep in mind that packing/unpacking a 7z file takes much longer than the regular ZIP, though.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Burning CDs/DVDs</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm">ISORecorder</a></strong> &ndash; Simple tool for creating and burning image (.iso) files. Although ever since Windows XP there is a built-in tool for writing files on a CD/DVD, it does not allow burning entire disk images. This simple tool helps to resolve this problem, without a tool like  <a href="http://www.nero.com">Nero</a>, for example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://infrarecorder.org/">Infra Recorder</a></strong> &ndash; Infra  Recorder is much more capable than ISORecorder, as it supports BIN/CUE disk images, creation of audio/video disks, erasing RW (re-writable) diska, etc. Unfortunately it is still in beta, and this is obvious at some points (I did not have problems with the burning of disks itself, though).</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Encryption</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.gpg4win.org/">Gpg4Win</a></strong> &ndash; A must have tool for everyone, who wants to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a> under Windows, without paying the ridiculous 183 EURO (!) per license of <a href="http://eu.store.pgp.com/desktop_pro.html">PGP Desktop</a>. It has an Outlook integration, which is pretty good (I used it several years ago for the last time), Windows Explorer integration (so that you can encrypt/decrypt files easily) and almost everything you would need. And the best thing is, that the project is still supported and updated regularly.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Java</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://java.com">Java Runtime  Environment</a></strong> &ndash; If you want to use some of the programs in these posts, you would need a Java Runtime Environment. You can get it <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava/">here</a>. You can see sample Java applications <a href="http://java.com/en/java_in_action/">here</a>. Don&rsquo;t forget to check out the Java version of Quake 2 &ndash; <a href="http://bytonic.de/html/jake2_webstart.html">Jake 2</a>, an excellent example for everyone, who says that Java is slow.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Important updates</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Windows Service Pack</strong> &ndash; I&rsquo;d say it is obligatory to install the latest service pack (a package with updates and bugfixes) for the version of Windows you use, right after the initial installation. The bugfixes are usually worth the effort (which is to wait for about 10-15 minutes for the package to install). How you can install the latest service pack for Windows XP, for example, you can see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Office Service Pack</strong> &ndash; The purpose of the service pack for Microsoft Office is the same as the one for Windows &ndash; it contains improvements, which allow you to use the product more easily and reliably. For instruction on how to install the latest service pack for MS Office 2003, for example, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/870924">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardware drivers</strong> &ndash; The drivers you got when you bought your computer/laptop (on a CD probably) are almost certainly out-dated (not to mention that in some cases they don&rsquo;t even work). On the vendor&rsquo;s site (with a 99% chance) you can find newer and better versions. It is a good idea to visit the site and download the latest drivers. Save them somewhere (on a USB stick, for example) before you re-install &ndash; because if you don&rsquo;t manage to get the network to work after the Windows installation, this means you will not be able to download anything from the internet. If you have a laptop, it is easier &ndash; go to the manufacturer&rsquo;s site and locate the <strong>Support</strong> link, then search for the model number of your laptop. If you have a PC, however, you will have to download drivers for the motherboard and the video card separately (if the video is not built into the motherboard), and in some cases you might even have to download additional drivers, like for the audio card, for example. Apart from that, the procedure is similar &ndash; go to the vendor&rsquo;s site and locate the <strong>Support</strong> link. After that search for the component model number (you can probably see it on the papers you got when you purchased it).</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Other</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx">Process  Explorer</a></strong> &ndash; Very good task manager for Windows, much better than the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Manager">Windows Task  Manager</a>, that comes with Windows. It allows you to view all running processes, how much memory or processor time each process takes (including chronologically, for the last several minutes), kill selected processes (much more invasive than usual), etc. If your machine slows down occasionally and you have no idea why, try Process Explorer, it might help you identify the problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/">JDiskReport</a></strong> &ndash; Quite simple and at the same time useful tool. It requires Java (see above). It helps when you experience shortage in disk space. It scans the disk or directory you pointed to, and tells you how much space each file/directory occupies on the hard drive. This helps you to identify the files/directories that take too much space and you don&rsquo;t need (or you probably forgot to delete, for example). It integrates into Windows Explorer, so if you choose a directory or a drive and right-click on it, you have the option to start JDiskReport directly for the selected directory/drive.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you watched a few of Seth Godin&rsquo;s presentation (e.g. the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZnYRaQfjK4">one at Google</a> or the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBIVlM435Zg">one at TED 2003</a>), you probably notices, that they look alike. The ideas are similar, some of the slides as well. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing (and his presentations are interesting, without a doubt) &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that when you see something several times, you&rsquo;re fed with it.</p>

<p>The presentation below, however, is an exception &ndash; the subject and the contents are different. Seth Godin talks about how he published his books and how you can innovate to enable successful marketing of the product (the book). Including how you can put a book for download on the internet free of charge, and make a bunch of money off of the special edition sold on <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Who is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin">Seth Godin</a>?</p>

<ul>
<li>Author of several marketing bestsellers (<em>as the post title suggests</em>), including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permission_marketing">Permission  Marketing</a></li>
<li>One of the most famous marketing specialists and <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">bloggers</a></li>
<li>One of the most popular internet bloggers in general</li>
</ul>


<p>And it is not required to be interested in marketing to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/typepad/sethsmainblog">follow his blog</a>, but it helps (I guess).</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. Note that the visiting team&rsquo;s name comes first (in contrast to what we are used to in Bulgaria). The coolest thing is, that you can see the results for the games, that have passed &ndash; and you thought nobody cares about the Bulgarian football&hellip;
You can also add the games of other teams, you feel passionate about, from other championships.</p>

<p>On the fifth step if you choose <strong>Holidays</strong>, you can add the official holidays for different countries in the world (alas, Bulgaria is missing). This way if you are working with Americans, for example, you can impress them by congratulating them in time.
If you choose <strong>More</strong>, there are other interesting calendars you can use &ndash; e.g. moon phases, consecutive day of the year, consecutive week of the year, sunrise and sunset times for your city, etc.</p>
